<h1 id="20-bug-bounty-hunting-process">20. Bug Bounty Hunting Process</h1>
<h2 id="bug-bounty-programs">Bug Bounty Programs</h2>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned in this module&#39;s summary, we usually consider a bug bounty program as a crowdsourcing initiative through which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for discovering and reporting software bugs.</p>
<p>Bug bounty programs are more than that, though. A bug bounty program (also called a vulnerability rewards program - VRP) is continuous and proactive security testing that supplements internal code audits and penetration tests and completes an organization&#39;s vulnerability management strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> aptly describes their bug bounty platform (that can host bug bounty programs) as &quot;Continuous testing, constant protection&quot; and as something that can be integrated seamlessly into an organization&#39;s existing development life cycle.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bug-bounty-program-types">Bug Bounty Program Types</h3>
<p>A bug bounty program can be <code>private</code> or <code>public</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Private bug bounty programs</code> are not publicly available. Bug bounty hunters can only participate in a private bug bounty program upon receiving specific invitations. The vast majority of bug bounty programs start as private ones and become public after getting the hang of receiving and triaging vulnerability reports.<ul>
<li>Most of the time, bug bounty hunters receive invitations to private bug bounty programs based on their track record, valid finding consistency, and violation record. A representative example of this is how <code>HackerOne</code> deals with <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/invitations.html">invitations</a> based on specific criteria. Please note that certain bug bounty programs may even require a background check.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Public bug bounty programs</code> are accessible by the entire hacking community.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8368957-parent-child-programs">Parent/Child Programs</a> also exist where a bounty pool and a single cyber security team are shared between a parent company and its subsidiaries. If a subsidiary launches a bug bounty program (child program), this program will be linked to the parent one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something important to note is that the terms <code>Bug Bounty Program (BBP)</code> and <code>Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)</code> should not be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>A vulnerability disclosure program only provides guidance on how an organization prefers receiving information on identified vulnerabilities by third parties. A bug bounty program incentivizes third parties to discover and report software bugs, and bug bounty hunters receive monetary rewards in return.</p>
<p>If you want to study the anatomy of a vulnerability disclosure program, refer to the following resource. <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/organizations/vdp-vs-bbp.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper">VDP vs. BBP</a></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bug-bounty-program-code-of-conduct">Bug Bounty Program Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>The violation record of a bug bounty hunter is always taken into consideration. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to adhere to the code of conduct/policy of each bug bounty program or bug bounty platform. Spend considerable time reading the code of conduct as it does not just establish expectations for behavior but also makes bug bounty hunters more effective and successful during their bug report submissions.</p>
<p>If you want to become an established bug bounty hunter, you will have to strike a balance between professionalism and technical capability.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest that you go over <a href="https://www.hacker101.com/resources/articles/code\_of\_conduct">HackerOne&#39;s Code of Conduct</a> to familiarize yourself with such documents.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bug-bounty-program-structure">Bug Bounty Program Structure</h3>
<p>It is about time we see what a bug bounty program looks like. Navigate to <a href="https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs">HackerOne&#39;s bug bounty program list</a> to go over some bug bounty programs. Take <a href="https://hackerone.com/alibaba?type=team">Alibaba BBP</a> and <a href="https://hackerone.com/amazonvrp?type=team">Amazon Vulnerability Research Program</a> as examples and go through their &quot;Policy.&quot;</p>
<p>According to HackerOne: The <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/policy-and-scope.html">policy section</a> enables organizations to publish information about their program to communicate the specifics about their program to hackers. Organizations typically publish a vulnerability disclosure policy with guidance on how they want to receive information related to potential vulnerabilities in their products or online services. The policy also includes the program’s <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/defining-scope.html">scope</a>, which lists items hackers can test and send reports in for. It is often defined by the domain name for web applications or by the specific App Store / Play store mobile apps that a company builds.</p>
<p>A bug bounty program usually consists of the following elements:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Vendor Response SLAs</code></td>
<td>Defines when and how the vendor will reply</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Access</code></td>
<td>Defines how to create or obtain accounts for research purposes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Eligibility Criteria</code></td>
<td>For example, be the first reporter of a vulnerability to be eligible, etc.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>In <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne&#39;s</a> case, the above are usually included inside the <code>Policy</code> part of each program.</p>
<p>Please go over a bug bounty program&#39;s description/policy meticulously. The same goes for any &quot;code of conduct&quot; documents they may include. By doing so, you can meet expectations and avoid unnecessary back and forth that could cause significant time loss. In bug bounty hunting, time is of the essence!</p>

<h3 id="finding-bug-bounty-programs">Finding Bug Bounty Programs</h3>
<p>One of the best online resources to identify bug bounty programs of your liking is <a href="https://hackerone.com/directory/programs">HackerOne&#39;s Directory</a>. HackerOne&#39;s directory can be used for identifying both organizations that have a bug bounty program and contact information to report vulnerabilities you have ethically found.</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-good-report">Writing a Good Report</h2>
<hr>
<p>By documenting our findings clearly and concisely, we get straight to our point in a way that the security or triage team can comprehend. Most importantly, bug reports should include information on how exploitation of each vulnerability can be reproduced step-by-step.</p>
<p>Please note that when reporting to less mature companies, we may have to translate technical security issues into more understandable/business terms for them to understand the actual impact of each vulnerability.</p>
<p>The essential elements of a good bug report are (the element order can vary):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Vulnerability Title</code></td>
<td>Including vulnerability type, affected domain/parameter/endpoint, impact etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>CWE &amp; CVSS score</code></td>
<td>For communicating the characteristics and severity of the vulnerability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Vulnerability Description</code></td>
<td>Better understanding of the vulnerability cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Proof of Concept (POC)</code></td>
<td>Steps to reproduce exploiting the identified vulnerability clearly and concisely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Impact</code></td>
<td>Elaborate more on what an attacker can achieve by fully exploiting the vulnerability. Business impact and maximum damage should be included in the impact statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Remediation</code></td>
<td>Optional in bug bounty programs, but good to have.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Readable and well-formatted bug reports can drastically minimize both vulnerability reproduction time and time to triage.</p>

<h3 id="why-cwe-cvss-">Why CWE &amp; CVSS?</h3>
<p>MITRE describes <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/">Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE)</a> as a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. In the case of a vulnerability chain, choose a CWE related to the initial vulnerability.</p>
<p>When it comes to communicating the severity of an identified vulnerability, then <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a> should be used, as it is a published standard used by organizations worldwide.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="using-cvss-calculator">Using CVSS Calculator</h3>
<p>Let us now see how we can use the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1">CVSS v3.1 Calculator</a> identify the severity of an identified vulnerability.</p>
<p>We will focus on the <code>Base Score</code> area only.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/14.png" alt="image"></p>
<p><strong>Attack Vector</strong></p>
<p>Shows how the vulnerability can be exploited.</p>

<h2 id="interacting-with-organizations-bbp-hosts">Interacting with Organizations/BBP Hosts</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suppose that you have submitted a bug report. How should you interact with the security/triage team after that?</p>
<p>Well, to begin with, do not interact with them. Allow the security/triage team some time to process your report, validate your finding, and maybe ask questions. Some bug bounty programs/platforms include vendor response SLAs or response efficiency metrics, which can give you an idea of how long it can take for them to get back to a submission. Also, make sure that you do not spam the security/triage team within a short period of time.</p>
<p>If the security/triage team does not get back to you in a reasonable amount of time, then if the submission was through a bug bounty platform, you can contact <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-mediation.html">Mediation</a>.</p>
<p>Once the security/triage team gets back to you, note the team member&#39;s username and tag them in any future communications since they will probably be dealing with your submission. Do not interact with the security/triage team through any unofficial communication channel (social media etc.)!</p>
<p>A professional bug report should be accompanied by professional communication. Remain calm and interact with the security/triage team as a security professional would.</p>
<p>During your interaction with the security/triage team, there could be disagreements about the severity of the bug or the bounty. A bug&#39;s impact and severity play a significant role during the bounty amount assignment. In the case of such a disagreement, proceed as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain your rationale for choosing this severity score and guide the security/triage team through each metric value you specified in the CVSS calculator. Eventually, you will come to an agreement.</li>
<li>Go over the bug bounty program&#39;s policy and scope and ensure that your submission complies with both. Also, make sure that the bounty amount resembles the policy of the bug bounty program.</li>
<li>If none of the above was fruitful, contact mediation or a similar platform service.</li>

<h2 id="example-1-reporting-stored-xss">Example 1: Reporting Stored XSS</h2>
<hr>
<p><code>Title</code>: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in X Admin Panel</p>
<p><code>CWE</code>: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html">CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (&#39;Cross-site Scripting&#39;)</a></p>
<p><code>CVSS 3.1 Score</code>: 5.5 (Medium)</p>
<p><code>Description</code>: During our testing activities, we identified that the &quot;X for administrators&quot; web application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied data. Specifically, the file uploading mechanism at &quot;Admin Info&quot; -&gt; &quot;Secure Data Transfer&quot; -&gt; &quot;Load of Data&quot; utilizes a value obtained from user input, specifically the uploaded file&#39;s filename, which is not only directly reflected back to the user’s browser but is also stored into the web application’s database. However, this value does not appear to be adequately sanitized. It, therefore, results in the application being vulnerable to reflected and stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks since JavaScript code can be entered in the filename field.</p>
<p><code>Impact</code>: Cross-Site Scripting issues occur when an application uses untrusted data supplied by offensive users in a web browser without sufficient prior validation or escaping. A potential attacker can embed untrusted code within a client-side script to be executed by the browser while interpreting the page. Attackers utilize XSS vulnerabilities to execute scripts in a legitimate user&#39;s browser leading to user credentials theft, session hijacking, website defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. Anyone that can send data to the system, including administrators, are possible candidates for performing XSS attacks against the vulnerable application. This issue introduces a significant risk since the vulnerability resides in the &quot;X for administrators” web application, and the uploaded files are visible and accessible by every administrator. Consequently, any administrator can be a possible target of a Cross-Site Scripting attack.</p>
<p><code>POC</code>:</p>
<p>Step 1: A malicious administrator could leverage the fact that the filename value is reflected back to the browser and stored in the web application’s database to perform cross-site scripting attacks against other administrators by uploading a file containing malicious JavaScript code into its filename. The attack is feasible because administrators can view all uploaded files regardless of the uploader. Specifically, we named the file, as follows, using a Linux machine.</p>
<p>Code: javascript</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">"&gt;<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">svg</span> <span class="hljs-attr">onload</span> = <span class="hljs-string">alert(document.cookie)</span>&gt;</span>.docx
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Step 2: When another administrator clicks the view button to open the abovementioned file, the malicious JavaScript code in the file’s filename will be executed on the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/3.png" alt="image"> <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/4.png" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="example-2-reporting-csrf">Example 2: Reporting CSRF</h2>
<hr>
<p><code>Title</code>: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Consumer Registration</p>
<p><code>CWE</code>: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html">CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></p>
<p><code>CVSS 3.1 Score</code>: 5.4 (Medium)</p>
<p><code>Description</code>: During our testing activities, we identified that the web page responsible for consumer registration is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where an attacker tricks the victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. It is malicious in the sense that it inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim&#39;s behalf, like change the victim&#39;s e-mail address, home address, or password, or purchase something. CSRF attacks generally target functions that cause a state change on the server but can also be used to access sensitive data.</p>
<p><code>Impact</code>: The impact of a CSRF flaw varies depending on the nature of the vulnerable functionality. An attacker could effectively perform any operations as the victim. Because the attacker has the victim&#39;s identity, the scope of CSRF is limited only by the victim&#39;s privileges. Specifically, an attacker can register a fintech application and create an API key as the victim in this case.</p>
<p><code>POC</code>:</p>
<p>Step 1: Using an intercepting proxy, we looked into the request to create a new fintech application. We noticed no anti-CSRF protections being in place.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/5.png" alt="image"> <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/6.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Step 2: We used the abovementioned request to craft a malicious HTML page that, if visited by a victim with an active session, a cross-site request will be performed, resulting in the advertent creation of an attacker-specific fintech application.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/7.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Step 3: To complete the attack, we would have to send our malicious web page to a victim having an open session. The following image displays the actual cross-site request that would be issued if the victim visited our malicious web page.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/161/8.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Step 4: The result would be the inadvertent creation of a new fintech application by the victim. It should be noted that this attack could have taken place in the background if combined with finding 6.1.1. &lt;-- 6.1.1 was an XSS vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="example-3-reporting-rce">Example 3: Reporting RCE</h2>
<hr>
<p><code>Title</code>: IBM WebSphere Java Object Deserialization RCE</p>
<p><code>CWE</code>: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html">CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data</a></p>
<p><code>CVSS 3.1 Score</code>: 9.8 (Critical)</p>
<p><code>Description</code>: During our testing activities, we identified that the remote WebSphere application server is affected by a vulnerability related to insecure Java object deserialization allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands. By issuing a request to the remote WebSphere application server over HTTPS on port 8880, we identified the existence of raw, serialized Java objects that were base64-encoded. It is possible to identify base64 encoded serialized Java objects by the &quot;rO0&quot; header. We were able to craft a SOAP request containing a serialized Java object that can exploit the aforementioned vulnerability in the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library used by the WebSphere application server. The crafted Java object contained a <code>ping</code> command to be executed by the affected system.</p>
<p><code>Impact</code>: Command injection vulnerabilities typically occur when data enters the application from an untrusted source, such as a terminal or a network socket, without authenticating the source, or the data is part of a string that is executed as a command by the application, again without validating the input against a predefined list of allowed commands, such as a whitelist. The application executes the provided command under the current user&#39;s security context. If the application is executed as a privileged user, administrative or driver interface, such as the SYSTEM account, it can potentially allow the complete takeover of the affected system.</p>
<p><code>POC</code>:</p>
<p>Step 1: We identified that the application uses serialized data objects by capturing and decoding a request to port 8880 of the server. The following images display the original request and the remote server&#39;s response, along with its decoded content.</p>

<p>Step 2: We crafted a SOAP request containing a command to be executed by the remote server. The command would send <code>ping</code> messages from the affected server to our host. The image below displays the crafted request and its decoded payload.</p>

<p>Step 3: The following image displays the crafted SOAP request allowing to remotely execute a <code>ping</code> command from the affected system. Capturing traffic via Wireshark, we observed the <code>ping</code> request from the Websphere application server to our machine.</p>
