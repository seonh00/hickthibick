<h2 id="introduction-to-security-incident-reporting">Introduction to Security Incident Reporting</h2>
<p>In today&#39;s landscape, the question isn&#39;t whether a security incident will transpire, but rather when it will occur. Enterprises, governmental bodies, and individual users have grown exceedingly dependent on technology, which serves as the cornerstone for the vast majority of our activities.</p>
<p>While this technological advancement has augmented operational efficiency, revenue generation, and output, it has concomitantly escalated the associated risks. These technological platforms have become fertile grounds for malevolent actors, sponsored by both state and non-state entities. A meticulously designed and streamlined incident reporting mechanism is pivotal for any organization&#39;s preparedness to counter these emerging threats effectively.</p>
<p>Security incident reporting serves as a conduit between the identification and remediation of threats. It facilitates the archival of past incidents, thereby providing an invaluable repository for lessons learned from previous mistakes. This repository can be seamlessly integrated into a broader strategy for preempting and mitigating future threats. Given the perpetually evolving threat landscape, a comprehensive and consistent incident reporting framework is indispensable for ensuring that organizations and their workforce are optimally prepared for any contingencies.</p>
<p>Beyond merely reacting to threats, an efficacious reporting protocol also fulfills other internal organizational imperatives. Whether it&#39;s legal departments ensuring regulatory compliance, executive management assessing risk profiles, or CFOs evaluating financial repercussions, a well-structured incident report serves as a clarifying instrument for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Effective incident reporting should strike a balance between granularity and accessibility, making it comprehensible to both technically savvy and non-technical audiences. This module&#39;s objective is to refine your grasp of the nuances involved in proficient incident reporting.</p>
<h3 id="incident-identification-and-categorisation">Incident Identification and Categorisation</h3>
<p>Navigating the labyrinthine array of cybersecurity threats that could potentially impact you or your organization necessitates a methodical approach to identifying and classifying security incidents. This enables the rapid allocation of resources and expedites threat mitigation. Essentially, the cornerstone of an initial successful response to an incident lies in the capability to promptly identify and categorize the threat.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Security Incidents</strong></p>
<p>Security incidents can emanate from a diverse array of sources and often manifest as detections, anomalies, or deviations from established baselines. There are primarily three key sources for incident identification:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Source</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Security Systems/Tooling in Place</td>
<td>There is a wide variety of security systems and tools likely in place within your organization. Some excellent sources for identification include IDS/IPS, EDR/XDR, SIEM tools, or even basic anti-virus alerts and NetFlow data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Human Observations</td>
<td>Users may notice and report suspicious activities, unusual emails, or systems behaving abnormally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third Party Notifications</td>
<td>Partners, vendors, or even customers might inform organizations about any vulnerabilities or breaches they are experiencing.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Categorising Security Incidents</strong></p>
<p>Upon identification of an incident, it is imperative to categorize it to facilitate the prioritization and allocation of resources for an effective response. This categorization also aids in comprehending the nature of the incident, thereby informing subsequent briefings to stakeholders.</p>
<p>Examples of Incident Types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Malware</code>: Malicious software encompassing viruses, worms, and ransomware.</li>
<li><code>Phishing</code>: Fraudulent endeavors to exfiltrate sensitive information, predominantly via email.</li>
<li><code>DDoS Attacks</code>: Deliberate attempts to inundate a system or network, thereby disrupting its regular functionality.</li>
<li><code>Unauthorised Access</code>: Incidents where unauthorized entities gain access to systems or data repositories.</li>
<li><code>Data Leakage</code>: Inadvertent exposure of confidential data, both within and outside the organizational perimeter.</li>
<li><code>Physical Breach</code>: Unauthorized physical access to secure locations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incident Severity Levels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Critical</code> (P1): Imminent threats that jeopardize core business functionalities or sensitive data, necessitating immediate intervention.</li>
<li><code>High</code> (P2): Latent threats to business operations that, while not immediately detrimental, are of elevated priority.</li>
<li><code>Medium</code> (P3): Incidents that, although not posing an immediate threat to business operations, warrant timely attention.</li>
<li><code>Low</code> (P4): Trivial incidents or routine anomalies that can be managed within standard operational workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s crucial to recognize that incidents frequently straddle multiple categories and can dynamically shift in both category and severity as additional intelligence is garnered during the analysis phase. The fluid nature of these threats mandates a flexible yet structured approach to both identification and categorization.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, adept identification and categorization constitute the bedrock of any proficient Security Operations Center (SOC). These processes dictate the alacrity, precision, and effectiveness of the response measures, and consequently, the mitigation strategies.</p>
<h2 id="the-incident-reporting-process">The Incident Reporting Process</h2>
<p>The reporting process serves as the cohesive framework that binds all elements of security incident reporting. An effective, overarching reporting mechanism delivers not just clarity and direction, but also highly actionable insights. In this section, we&#39;ll dissect the requisite steps within this process.</p>
<p><strong>1. Initial Detection &amp; Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>Before any incident can be formally reported, it must first be detected and acknowledged. Detection vectors can vary, ranging from human observation to automated alerts generated by deployed security tools. In some cases, the threat actor themselves may trigger the detection, especially if you&#39;re dealing with a ransomware incident.</p>
<p><strong>2. Preliminary Analysis</strong></p>
<p>During this phase, the scope and potential ramifications of the security incident must be ascertained. The incident should be categorized based on our previously established classification and severity metrics.</p>
<p><strong>3. Incident Logging</strong></p>
<p>Every facet, action, and observation related to the security incident should be meticulously logged using an established system. Popular platforms for this purpose include <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> and <a href="https://thehive-project.org/">TheHive Project</a>. In the absence of such a system, alternative methods should be employed. Even rudimentary tools like pen and paper or a spreadsheet can suffice in a pinch.</p>
<p><strong>4. Notification of Relevant Parties</strong></p>
<p>Stakeholders must be promptly identified, and notifications should be segmented into:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Internal Communications</code><ul>
<li>Relevant internal departments, such as IT, legal, PR, and executive teams, should be alerted. In cases where the incident has widespread and severe implications, an organization-wide notification may be warranted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>External Communications</code><ul>
<li>Depending on the incident&#39;s nature and impact, external communications may be necessary. This could involve notifying customers, partners, regulatory bodies, or even the general public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Detailed Investigation &amp; Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The duration of this phase can vary significantly, ranging from a couple of days to potentially years. What&#39;s crucial here is a comprehensive technical analysis coupled with a compilation of all findings. This in-depth investigation is vital for understanding the incident&#39;s full impact.</p>
<p><strong>6. Final Report Creation</strong></p>
<p>The culmination of your role as a security analyst or incident responder is the creation of a finalized incident report. This document will furnish regulators, insurers, and executive leadership with a detailed account of the incident, its origins, and the remedial actions taken.</p>
<p><strong>7. Feedback Loop!</strong></p>
<p>Post-incident reflection is essential for enhancing our preparedness for future incidents. This involves revisiting and analyzing the incident to identify areas for improvement.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Far from being a mere procedural formality, the reporting process is a strategic asset that enhances an organization&#39;s resilience against security threats. Through rigorous documentation, analysis, and learning from each incident, organizations can convert challenges into opportunities for bolstering their security stance.</p>

<h2 id="communications">Communications</h2>
<p>In the midst of any crisis, effective communication is not just beneficial but crucial. The stakes are even higher during a security incident, where transparency, coordinated response efforts, and trust-building with stakeholders are paramount.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s dissect the various facets of communications and highlight some key components.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-effective-communications">Importance of Effective Communications</h3>
<p>The significance of adept communications is multi-faceted and can be segmented into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Trust</strong></p>
<p>Transparent and coherent communication is instrumental in preserving stakeholder trust throughout an incident. It serves as a testament to an organization&#39;s responsibility, transparency, and command over the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination &amp; Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Alignment among all parties involved is especially vital. A cybersecurity incident is not an isolated event affecting only the technical team; it has broader organizational implications. Keeping everyone on the same page is not just advisable but essential.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s imperative to cross-verify the regulatory compliance mandates specific to your organization. These guidelines should be explicitly documented in your Incident Response Plan (IRP).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="internal-communications">Internal Communications</h3>
<p>While often sidelined, internal communications are pivotal for conveying a consistent message across the organization. This becomes increasingly important in the event of information leaks, which are not uncommon within corporate settings. Let&#39;s look at some key elements of internal communications:</p>
<p><strong>Immediate notification</strong></p>
<p>Upon acknowledgment of an incident, stakeholders must be promptly informed.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Updates</strong></p>
<p>Consistent, periodic briefings should be disseminated to all involved teams. This ensures a shared understanding of the incident&#39;s status, its potential ramifications, and any pending actions.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback Loop</strong></p>
<p>A feedback loop should be established as a conduit for teams to exchange findings, voice concerns, or offer suggestions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="external-communications">External Communications</h3>
<p>External communications are equally critical and often encompass a diverse array of third parties, from customers to governmental agencies and regulatory bodies. Navigating this landscape requires finesse and careful planning. Here are some key aspects to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Affected Parties</strong></p>
<p>Direct communication should be established with any parties impacted by the incident, be they customers, clients, or business partners.</p>
<p><strong>Public Statement</strong></p>
<p>For incidents of significant scale, a public statement may be warranted. Such a statement should be lucid and steer clear of overly technical jargon to prevent confusion among customers and other third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Bodies</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of the incident, you may be obligated to notify regulatory entities like the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) within a stipulated timeframe.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="navigating-communication-channels-during-cybersecurity-incidents">Navigating Communication Channels During Cybersecurity Incidents</h3>
<p>When we&#39;re hit with a cybersecurity incident, the way we communicate becomes a linchpin for both our security posture and our compliance standing. Let&#39;s dissect the technical landscape of these communication channels and their intertwined implications.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security Dimensions of Communication Channels</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Encryption</code>: We must ensure that every piece of information we share is wrapped in robust end-to-end encryption. This is non-negotiable, especially when we&#39;re discussing the nitty-gritty of the incident, like which systems took a hit or which vulnerabilities got exploited.</li>
<li><code>Authentication and Authorization</code>: Access to our communication channels should be as tight as Fort Knox. We can&#39;t stress enough the importance of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to double-check the identities of those trying to access the channel.</li>
<li><code>Data Integrity</code>: We need to be certain that our messages remain unaltered during transit. Cryptographic hashing techniques can be our best bet to ensure the integrity of our communications.</li>
<li><code>Ephemeral Communications</code>: For those top-secret discussions, we might consider using messaging platforms that auto-destruct messages post-reading. This minimizes the risk of any prying eyes accessing our sensitive data later on.</li>
<li><code>Air-Gapped Communications</code>: In situations where we suspect our primary communication backbone might be under threat, we might need to resort to air-gapped systems. These systems are our last line of defense, completely isolated from other potentially compromised networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Dimensions of Communication Channels</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Data Privacy Laws</code>: We&#39;re operating in a world where data privacy regulations, like the EU&#39;s GDPR, hold significant sway. If we&#39;re discussing or sharing personal data, especially of EU residents, we need to toe the line with GDPR mandates.</li>
<li><code>Breach Notification Mandates</code>: Certain jurisdictions have clear-cut timelines for breach notifications. We need to be aware of these when communicating about data breaches, ensuring we&#39;re not only timely but also adhering to the content guidelines set by these laws.</li>
<li><code>Record-Keeping</code>: While we might lean towards ephemeral messages for security, some regulations mandate a clear record of all incident-related communications. It&#39;s a tightrope walk, but we need to find that balance.</li>
<li><code>Cross-Border Communications</code>: When our incident spills over national borders, the communication game changes. Some nations have stringent data sovereignty laws, dictating the hows and wheres of data transmission and storage.</li>
<li><code>Chain of Custody</code>: If there&#39;s even a hint that legal actions might follow the incident, we need to maintain an unbroken chain of custody for all communications. This ensures that if we need to present evidence in court, it&#39;s deemed admissible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="real-world-incident-report">Real-world Incident Report</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Incident ID</code></strong>: INC2019-0422-022</li>
<li><strong><code>Incident Severity</code></strong>: High (P2)</li>
<li><strong><code>Incident Status</code></strong>: Resolved</li>
<li><p><strong><code>Incident Overview</code></strong>: On the night of <code>April 22, 2019</code>, at precisely <code>01:05:00</code>, SampleCorp&#39;s Security Operations Center (SOC) detected unauthorized activity within the internal network, specifically through anomalous process initiation and suspicious-looking PowerShell commands. Leveraging the lack of robust network access controls and two security vulnerabilities, the unauthorized entity successfully gained control over the following nodes within SampleCorp&#39;s infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code>: A system used for software development purposes.</li>
<li><code>HR01.samplecorp.com</code>: A system used to process employee and partner data.</li>
</ul>
<p>SampleCorp&#39;s SOC, in collaboration with the Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) units, managed to successfully contain the threat, eliminate both the introduced malicious software and existing security gaps, and ultimately restore the compromised systems to their original state.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Key Findings</code></strong>: Owing to insufficient network access controls, the unauthorized entity was assigned an internal IP address by simply connecting their computer to an Ethernet port within a SampleCorp office. Investigative efforts revealed that the unauthorized entity initially compromised <code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code> by exploiting a vulnerable version of <code>Acrobat Reader</code>. Additionally, the entity exploited a <code>buffer overflow vulnerability</code>, this time in a proprietary application developed by SampleCorp, to further penetrate the internal network. While no widespread data exfiltration was detected, likely owing to the rapid intervention by the SOC and DFIR teams, the unauthorized access to both <code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code> and <code>HR01.samplecorp.com</code> raise concerns. As a result, both company and client data should be regarded as potentially compromised to some extent.</li>
<li><strong><code>Immediate Actions</code></strong>: SampleCorp&#39;s SOC and DFIR teams exclusively managed the incident response procedures, without the involvement of any external service providers. Immediate action was taken to isolate the compromised systems from the network through the use of VLAN segmentation. To facilitate a comprehensive investigation, the SOC and DFIR teams gathered extensive data. This included getting access to network traffic capture files. Additionally, all affected systems were plugged to a host security solution. As for event logs, they were automatically collected by the existing Elastic SIEM solution.</li>
<li><strong><code>Stakeholder Impact</code></strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Customers</code>: While no extensive data exfiltration was identified, the unauthorized access to both <code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code> and <code>HR01.samplecorp.com</code> raises concerns about the integrity and confidentiality of customer data. As a precautionary measure, some services were temporarily taken offline and some API keys were revoked, leading to brief periods of downtime for customers. The financial implications of this downtime are currently being assessed but could result in loss of revenue and customer trust.</li>
<li><code>Employees</code>: The compromised systems included <code>HR01.samplecorp.com</code>, which typically houses sensitive employee information. Although we have no evidence to suggest that employee data was specifically targeted or extracted, the potential risk remains. Employees may be subject to identity theft or phishing attacks if their data was compromised.</li>
<li><code>Business Partners</code>: Given that <code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code>, a development environment, was among the compromised systems, there&#39;s a possibility that proprietary code or technology could have been exposed. This could have ramifications for business partners who rely on the integrity and exclusivity of SampleCorp&#39;s technology solutions.</li>
<li><code>Regulatory Bodies</code>: The breach of systems, could have compliance implications. Regulatory bodies may impose fines or sanctions on SampleCorp for failing to adequately protect sensitive data, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the compromised data.</li>
<li><code>Internal Teams</code>: The SOC and DFIR teams were able to contain the threat effectively, but the incident will likely necessitate a review and potential overhaul of current security measures. This could mean a reallocation of resources and budget adjustments, impacting other departments and projects.</li>
<li><code>Shareholders</code>: The incident could have a short-term negative impact on stock prices due to the potential loss of customer trust and possible regulatory fines. Long-term effects will depend on the effectiveness of the remedial actions taken and the company&#39;s ability to restore stakeholder confidence.</li>

<li><strong><code>cv.pdf</code></strong> (SHA256): ef59d7038cfd565fd65bae12588810d5361df938244ebad33b71882dcf683011</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Insufficient network access controls allowed the unauthorized entity access to SampleCorp&#39;s internal network.</p>
<p>The primary catalysts for the incident were traced back to two significant vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability stemmed from the continued use of an outdated version of Acrobat Reader, while the second was attributed to a buffer overflow issue present within a proprietary application. Compounding these vulnerabilities was the inadequate network segregation of crucial systems, leaving them more exposed and easier targets for potential threats. Additionally, there was a notable gap in user awareness, evident from the absence of comprehensive training against phishing tactics, which could have served as the initial entry point for the attackers.</p>

<p><strong>Nature of the Attack</strong></p>
<p>In this segment, we should meticulously dissect the modus operandi of the unauthorized entity, shedding light on the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they employed throughout their intrusion. For instance, let&#39;s dive into the methods the SOC team used to determine that the unauthorized entity utilized the Metasploit framework in their operations.</p>
<p><strong>Detecting Metasploit</strong></p>
<p>To better understand the tactics and techniques of the unauthorized entity, we delved into the malicious PowerShell commands executed.</p>
<p>Particularly, the one shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/double\_enc.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon inspection, it became clear that double encoding was used, likely as a means to bypass detection mechanisms. The SOC team successfully decoded the malicious payload, revealing the exact PowerShell code executed within the memory of <code>WKST01.samplecorp.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/decoded.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By leveraging open source intelligence, our SOC team determined that this PowerShell code is probably linked to the <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">Metasploit</a> post-exploitation framework.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/meter\_refl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To support our hypothesis that <code>Metasploit</code> was used, we dived deeper into the detected shellcode. We specifically exported the packet bytes containing the shellcode (as <code>a.bin</code>) and subsequently submitted them to VirusTotal for evaluation.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/packets1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/packets2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/238/packets3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The results from VirusTotal affirmed our suspicion that <code>Metasploit</code> was in play. Both <code>metacoder</code> and <code>shikata</code> are intrinsically linked to the Metasploit-generated shellcode.</p>
