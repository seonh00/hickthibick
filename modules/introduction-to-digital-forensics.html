<p><code>Evidence acquisition</code> is a critical phase in digital forensics, involving the collection of digital artifacts and data from various sources to preserve potential evidence for analysis. This process requires specialized tools and techniques to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and admissibility of the collected evidence. Here&#39;s an overview of evidence acquisition techniques commonly used in digital forensics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forensic Imaging</li>
<li>Extracting Host-based Evidence &amp; Rapid Triage</li>
<li>Extracting Network Evidence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forensic-imaging">Forensic Imaging</h3>
<p>Forensic imaging is a fundamental process in digital forensics that involves creating an exact, bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, and memory cards. This process is crucial for preserving the original state of the data, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining the admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings. Forensic imaging plays a critical role in investigations by allowing analysts to examine evidence without altering or compromising the original data.</p>
<p>Below are some forensic imaging tools and solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager">FTK Imager</a>: Developed by AccessData (now acquired by Exterro), FTK Imager is one of the most widely used disk imaging tools in the cybersecurity field. It allows us to create perfect copies (or images) of computer disks for analysis, preserving the integrity of the evidence. It also lets us view and analyze the contents of data storage devices without altering the data.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Velocidex/c-aff4">AFF4 Imager</a>: A free, open-source tool crafted for creating and duplicating forensic disk images. It&#39;s user-friendly and compatible with numerous file systems. A benefit of the AFF4 Imager is its capability to extract files based on their creation time, segment volumes, and reduce the time taken for imaging through compression.</li>
<li><code>DD and DCFLDD</code>: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS). DD is a versatile tool included in most Unix-based systems by default, while DCFLDD is an enhanced version of DD with features specifically useful for forensics, such as hashing.</li>
<li><code>Virtualization Tools</code>: Given the prevalent use of virtualization in modern systems, incident responders will often need to collect evidence from virtual environments. Depending on the specific virtualization solution, evidence can be gathered by temporarily halting the system and transferring the directory that houses it. Another method is to utilize the snapshot capability present in numerous virtualization software tools.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1: Forensic Imaging with FTK Imager</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s now see a demonstration of utilizing <code>FTK Imager</code> to craft a disk image. Be mindful that you&#39;ll require an auxiliary storage medium, like an external hard drive or USB flash drive, to save the resultant disk image.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Create Disk Image</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image11.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Next, select the media source. Typically, it&#39;s either <code>Physical Drive</code> or <code>Logical Drive</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image1.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Choose the drive from which you wish to create an image. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image3.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Specify the destination for the image. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image7.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Select the desired image type. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image4.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Input evidence details. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image10.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Choose the destination folder and filename for the image. At this step, you can also adjust settings for image fragmentation and compression. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image8.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Once all settings are confirmed, click <code>Start</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image2.png" alt=""></li>
<li>You&#39;ll observe the progress of the imaging. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image12.png" alt=""></li>
<li>If you opted to verify the image, you&#39;ll also see the verification progress. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image6.png" alt=""></li>
<li>After the image has been verified, you&#39;ll receive an imaging summary. Now, you&#39;re prepared to analyze this dump. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image9.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2: Mounting a Disk Image with Arsenal Image Mounter</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s now see another demonstration of utilizing <a href="https://arsenalrecon.com/downloads">Arsenal Image Mounter</a> to mount a disk image we have previously created (not the one mentioned above) from a compromised Virtual Machine (VM) running on VMWare. The virtual hard disk of the VM has been stored as <code>HTBVM01-000003.vmdk</code>.</p>
<p>After we&#39;ve installed Arsenal Image Mounter, let&#39;s ensure we launch it with <code>administrative rights</code>. In the main window of Arsenal Image Mounter, let&#39;s click on the <code>Mount disk image</code> button. From there, we&#39;ll navigate to the location of our <code>.VMDK</code> file and select it.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mount.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Arsenal Image Mounter will then start its analysis of the VMDK file. We&#39;ll also have the choice to decide if we want to mount the disk as <code>read-only</code> or <code>read-write</code>, based on our specific requirements.</p>
<p><em>Choosing to mount a disk image as read-only is a foundational step in digital forensics and incident response. This approach is vital for preserving the original state of evidence, ensuring its authenticity and integrity remain intact.</em></p>
<p>Once mounted, the image will appear as a drive, assigned the letter <code>D:\</code>.</p>

<h3 id="extracting-host-based-evidence-rapid-triage">Extracting Host-based Evidence &amp; Rapid Triage</h3>
<p><strong>Host-based Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Modern operating systems, with Microsoft Windows being a prime example, generate a plethora of evidence artifacts. These can arise from application execution, file modifications, or even the creation of user accounts. Each of these actions leaves behind a trail, providing invaluable insights for incident response analysts.</p>
<p>Evidence on a host system varies in its nature. The term <code>volatility</code> refers to the persistence of data on a host system after events like logoffs or power shutdowns. One crucial type of volatile evidence is the system&#39;s active memory. During investigations, especially those concerning malware infections, this live system memory becomes indispensable. Malware often leaves traces within system memory, and losing this evidence can hinder an analyst&#39;s investigation. To capture memory, tools like <a href="https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager">FTK Imager</a> are commonly employed.</p>
<p>Some other memory acquisition solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem">WinPmem</a>: WinPmem has been the default open source memory acquisition driver for windows for a long time. It used to live in the Rekall project, but has recently been separated into its own repository.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/">DumpIt</a>: A simplistic utility that generates a physical memory dump of Windows and Linux machines. On Windows, it concatenates 32-bit and 64-bit system physical memory into a single output file, making it extremely easy to use.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html">MemDump</a>: MemDump is a free, straightforward command-line utility that enables us to capture the contents of a system&#39;s RAM. It’s quite beneficial in forensics investigations or when analyzing a system for malicious activity. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for memory acquisition.</li>
<li><a href="https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer">Belkasoft RAM Capturer</a>: This is another powerful tool we can use for memory acquisition, provided free of charge by Belkasoft. It can capture the RAM of a running Windows computer, even if there&#39;s active anti-debugging or anti-dumping protection. This makes it a highly effective tool for extracting as much data as possible during a live forensics investigation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/">Magnet RAM Capture</a>: Developed by Magnet Forensics, this tool provides a free and simple way to capture the volatile memory of a system.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME">LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)</a>: LiME is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows the acquisition of volatile memory. LiME is unique in that it&#39;s designed to be transparent to the target system, evading many common anti-forensic measures.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image13.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Example 2: Acquiring VM Memory</strong></p>
<p>Here are the steps to acquire memory from a Virtual Machine (VM).</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the running VM&#39;s options</li>
<li>Suspend the running VM</li>
<li>Locate the <code>.vmem</code> file inside the VM&#39;s directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/suspend-vm.png" alt=""> <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/suspend-vmem.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>On the other hand, non-volatile data remains on the hard drive, typically persisting through shutdowns. This category includes artifacts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registry</li>
<li>Windows Event Log</li>
<li>System-related artifacts (e.g., Prefetch, Amcache)</li>
<li>Application-specific artifacts (e.g., IIS logs, Browser history)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rapid Triage</strong></p>
<p>This approach emphasizes collecting data from potentially compromised systems. The goal is to centralize high-value data, streamlining its indexing and analysis. By centralizing this data, analysts can more effectively deploy tools and techniques, honing in on systems with the most evidentiary value. This targeted approach allows for a deeper dive into digital forensics, offering a clearer picture of the adversary&#39;s actions.</p>
<p>One of the best, if not the best, rapid artifact parsing and extraction solutions is <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape">KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)</a>. Let&#39;s see how we can employ <code>KAPE</code> to retrieve valuable forensic data from the image we previously mounted with the help of Arsenal Image Mounter (<code>D:\</code>).</p>
<p><code>KAPE</code> is a powerful tool in the realm of digital forensics and incident response. Designed to aid forensic experts and investigators, KAPE facilitates the collection and analysis of digital evidence from Windows-based systems. Developed and maintained by <code>Kroll</code> (previously known as <code>Magnet Forensics</code>), KAPE is celebrated for its comprehensive collection features, adaptability, and intuitive interface. The diagram below illustrates KAPE&#39;s operational flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Image reference: <a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!index.md">https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!index.md</a></p>
<p>KAPE operates based on the principles of <code>Targets</code> and <code>Modules</code>. These elements guide the tool in processing data and extracting forensic artifacts. When we feed a source to KAPE, it duplicates specific forensic-related files to a designated output directory, all while maintaining the metadata of each file.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After downloading, let&#39;s unzip the file and launch KAPE. Within the KAPE directory, we&#39;ll notice two executable files: <code>gkape.exe</code> and <code>kape.exe</code>. KAPE provides users with two modes: CLI (<code>kape.exe</code>) and GUI (<code>gkape.exe</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_modes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&#39;s opt for the GUI version to explore the available options more visually.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_window.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The crux of the process lies in selecting the appropriate target configurations.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_target.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In KAPE&#39;s terminology, <code>Targets</code> refer to the specific artifacts we aim to extract from an image or system. These are then duplicated to the output directory.</p>
<p>KAPE&#39;s target files have a <code>.tkape</code> extension and reside in the <code>&lt;path to kape&gt;\KAPE\Targets</code> directory. For instance, the target <code>RegistryHivesSystem.tkape</code> in the screenshot below specifies the locations and file masks associated with system-related registry hives. In this target configuration, <code>RegistryHivesSystem.tkape</code> contains information to collect the files with file mask <code>SAM.LOG*</code> from the <code>C:\Windows\System32\config</code> directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_tkape.png" alt=""></p>
<p>KAPE also offers <code>Compound Targets</code>, which are essentially amalgamations of multiple targets. This feature accelerates the collection process by gathering multiple files defined across various targets in a single run. The <code>Compound</code> directory&#39;s <code>KapeTriage</code> file provides an overview of the contents of this compound target.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_compound.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&#39;s specify our source (in our scenario, it&#39;s <code>D:\</code>) and designate a location to store the harvested data. We can also determine an output folder to house the processed data from KAPE.</p>
<p>After configuring our options, let&#39;s hit the <code>Execute</code> button to initiate the data collection.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_gui.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon execution, KAPE will commence the collection, storing the results in the predetermined destination.</p>

<p>The output directory of KAPE houses the fruits of the artifact collection and processing. The exact contents of this directory can differ based on the artifacts selected and the configurations set. In our demonstration, we opted for the <code>!SANS_Triage</code> collection target configuration. Let&#39;s navigate to KAPE&#39;s output directory to inspect the harvested data.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_output.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the displayed results, it&#39;s evident that the <code>$MFT</code> file has been collected, along with the <code>Users</code> and <code>Windows</code> directories.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that KAPE has also harvested the <code>Windows event logs</code>, which are nestled within the Windows directory sub-folders.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_kape\_winevt.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>What if we wanted to perform artifact collection remotely and en masse? This is where EDR solutions and <a href="https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor">Velociraptor</a> come into play.</p>
<p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms offer a significant advantage for incident response analysts. They enable remote acquisition and analysis of digital evidence. For instance, EDR platforms can display recently executed binaries or newly added files. Instead of sifting through individual systems, analysts can search for such indicators across the entire network. Another benefit is the capability to gather evidence, be it specific files or comprehensive forensic packages. This functionality expedites evidence collection and facilitates large-scale searching and collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor">Velociraptor</a> is a potent tool for gathering host-based information using Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) queries. Beyond this, Velociraptor can execute <code>Hunts</code> to amass various artifacts. A frequently utilized artifact is the <code>Windows.KapeFiles.Targets</code>. While KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) itself isn&#39;t open-source, its file collection logic, encoded in YAML, is accessible via the <a href="https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles">KapeFiles project</a>. This approach is a staple in Rapid Triage.</p>
<p>To utilize Velociraptor for KapeFiles artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initiate a new Hunt. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/vel0.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image33.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Choose <code>Windows.KapeFiles.Targets</code> as the artifacts for collection. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image64.png" alt=""></li>
<li><p>Specify the collection to use. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/vel1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image19.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Click on <code>Launch</code> to start the hunt. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image27.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Once completed, download the results. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image90.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>Extracting the archive will reveal files related to the collected artifacts and all gathered files.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image12\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image37.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For remote memory dump collection using Velociraptor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start a new Hunt, but this time, select the <code>Windows.Memory.Acquisition</code> artifact. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image92.png" alt=""></li>
<li>After the Hunt concludes, download the resulting archive. Within, you&#39;ll find a file named <code>PhysicalMemory.raw</code>, containing the memory dump. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image45.png" alt=""></li>

<h3 id="extracting-network-evidence">Extracting Network Evidence</h3>
<p>Throughout our exploration of the modules in the <code>SOC Analyst</code> path, we&#39;ve delved extensively into the realm of network evidence, a fundamental aspect for any SOC analyst.</p>
<ul>
<li>First up, our <code>Intro to Network Traffic Analysis</code> and <code>Intermediate Network Traffic Analysis</code> modules covered <code>traffic capture analysis</code>. Think of traffic capture as a snapshot of all the digital conversations happening in our network. Tools like <code>Wireshark</code> or <code>tcpdump</code> allow us to capture and dissect these packets, giving us a granular view of data in transit.</li>
<li>Then, our <code>Working with IDS/IPS</code> and <code>Detecting Windows Attacks with Splunk</code> modules covered the usage of IDS/IPS-derived data. <code>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</code> are our watchful sentinels, constantly monitoring network traffic for signs of malicious activity. When they spot something amiss, they alert us. On the other hand, <code>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)</code> take it a step further. Not only do they detect, but they also take pre-defined actions to block or prevent those malicious activities.</li>
<li><code>Traffic flow</code> data, often sourced from tools like <code>NetFlow</code> or <code>sFlow</code>, provides us with a broader view of our network&#39;s behavior. While it might not give us the nitty-gritty details of each packet, it offers a high-level overview of traffic patterns.</li>
<li>Lastly, our trusty <code>firewalls</code>. These are not just barriers that block or allow traffic based on predefined rules. Modern firewalls are intelligent beasts. They can identify applications, users, and even detect and block threats. By analyzing firewall logs, we can uncover attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-forensics">Memory Forensics</h2>
<h3 id="memory-forensics-definition-process">Memory Forensics Definition &amp; Process</h3>
<p><code>Memory forensics</code>, also known as volatile memory analysis, is a specialized branch of digital forensics that focuses on the examination and analysis of the volatile memory (RAM) of a computer or digital device. Unlike traditional digital forensics, which involves analyzing data stored on non-volatile storage media like hard drives or solid-state drives, memory forensics deals with the live state of a system at a particular moment in time.</p>
<p>Here are some types of data found in RAM that are valuable for incident investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Network connections</code></li>
<li><code>File handles and open Files</code></li>
<li><code>Open registry keys</code></li>
<li><code>Running processes on the system</code></li>
<li><code>Loaded modules</code></li>
<li><code>Loaded device drivers</code></li>
<li><code>Command history and console sessions</code></li>
<li><code>Kernel data structures</code></li>
<li><code>User and credential information</code></li>
<li><code>Malware artifacts</code></li>
<li><code>System configuration</code></li>
<li><code>Process memory regions</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As we discussed both in the previous section and in the <code>YARA &amp; Sigma for SOC Analysts</code> module, when malware operates, it often leaves traces or footprints in a system&#39;s active memory. By analyzing this memory, investigators can uncover malicious processes, identify indicators of compromise, and reconstruct the malware&#39;s actions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in some cases, important data or encryption keys may reside in memory. Memory forensics can help recover this data, which may be crucial for an investigation.</p>
<p>The following outlines a systematic approach to memory forensics, formulated to aid in in-memory investigations and drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.sans.org/">SANS</a>&#39;s six-step memory forensics methodology.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Process Identification and Verification</code>: Let&#39;s begin by identifying all active processes. Malicious software often masquerades as legitimate processes, sometimes with subtle name variations to avoid detection. We need to:<ul>
<li>Enumerate all running processes.</li>
<li>Determine their origin within the operating system.</li>
<li>Cross-reference with known legitimate processes.</li>
<li>Highlight any discrepancies or suspicious naming conventions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Deep Dive into Process Components</code>: Once we&#39;ve flagged potentially rogue processes, our next step is to scrutinize the associated Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) and handles. Malware often exploits DLLs to conceal its activities. We should:<ul>
<li>Examine DLLs linked to the suspicious process.</li>
<li>Check for unauthorized or malicious DLLs.</li>
<li>Investigate any signs of DLL injection or hijacking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Network Activity Analysis</code>: Many malware strains, especially those that operate in stages, necessitate internet connectivity. They might beacon to Command and Control (C2) servers or exfiltrate data. To uncover these:<ul>
<li>Review active and passive network connections in the system&#39;s memory.</li>
<li>Identify and document external IP addresses and associated domains.</li>
<li>Determine the nature and purpose of the communication.<ul>
<li>Validate the process&#39; legitimacy.</li>
<li>Assess if the process typically requires network communication.</li>
<li>Trace back to the parent process.</li>
<li>Evaluate its behavior and necessity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Code Injection Detection</code>: Advanced adversaries often employ techniques like process hollowing or utilize unmapped memory sections. To counter this, we should:<ul>
<li>Use memory analysis tools to detect anomalies or signs of these techniques.</li>
<li>Identify any processes that seem to occupy unusual memory spaces or exhibit unexpected behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Rootkit Discovery</code>: Achieving stealth and persistence is a common goal for adversaries. Rootkits, which embed deep within the OS, grant threat actors continuous, often elevated, system access while evading detection. To tackle this:<ul>
<li>Scan for signs of rootkit activity or deep OS alterations.</li>
<li>Identify any processes or drivers operating at unusually high privileges or exhibiting stealth behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Extraction of Suspicious Elements</code>: After pinpointing suspicious processes, drivers, or executables, we need to isolate them for in-depth analysis. This involves:<ul>
<li>Dumping the suspicious components from memory.</li>
<li>Storing them securely for subsequent examination using specialized forensic tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Identifying Handles</strong></p>
<p>The <code>handles</code> plugin in Volatility is used for analyzing the handles (file and object references) held by a specific process within a memory dump. Understanding the handles associated with a process can provide valuable insights during incident response and digital forensics investigations, as it reveals the resources and objects a process is interacting with. Here&#39;s how to use the handles plugin.</p>

<h3 id="rootkit-analysis-with-volatility-v2">Rootkit Analysis with Volatility v2</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s now see a demonstration of utilizing <code>Volatility v2</code> to analyze a memory dump saved as <code>rootkit.vmem</code> inside the <code>/home/htb-student/MemoryDumps</code> directory of this section&#39;s target.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the EPROCESS Structure</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/kernel\_struct/vista/EPROCESS.html">EPROCESS</a> is a data structure in the Windows kernel that represents a process. Each running process in the Windows operating system has a corresponding <code>EPROCESS</code> block in kernel memory. During memory analysis, the examination of <code>EPROCESS</code> structures is crucial for understanding the running processes on a system, identifying parent-child relationships, and determining which processes were active at the time of the memory capture.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/dfir\_mem\_eprocess.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>FLINK and BLINK</strong></p>
<p>A doubly-linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It is a type of linked list where each node (record) contains two references or pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next Pointer</strong>: This points to the next node in the list, allowing us to traverse the list in a forward direction.</li>
<li><strong>Previous Pointer</strong>: This points to the previous node in the list, allowing us to traverse the list in a backward direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure, we have <code>ActiveProcessLinks</code> as the doubly-linked list which contains the <code>flink</code> field and the <code>blink</code> field.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>flink</strong>: Is a forward pointer that points to the <code>ActiveProcessLinks</code> list entry of the <code>_next_ EPROCESS</code> structure in the list of active processes.</li>
<li><strong>blink</strong>: Is a backward pointer within the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure that points to the <code>ActiveProcessLinks</code> list entry of the <code>_previous_ EPROCESS</code> structure in the list of active processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These linked lists of EPROCESS structures are used by the Windows kernel to quickly iterate through all running processes on the system. The below diagram shows how this linked list looks like.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/dfir\_mem\_dcom1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Identifying Rootkit Signs</strong></p>
<p><code>Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM)</code> is a sophisticated technique used by rootkits and advanced malware to manipulate the Windows operating system&#39;s kernel data structures in order to hide malicious processes, drivers, files, and other artifacts from detection by security tools and utilities running in userland (i.e., in user mode).</p>
<p>If, for example, a monitoring tool is dependent on the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure for the enumeration of the running processes, and there&#39;s a rootkit running on the system which manipulates the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure directly in kernel memory by altering the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure or unlinking a process from lists, the monitoring tool will not be able to get the hidden process in the currenlty running processes list.</p>
<p>The below screenshot shows a graphical representation of how this unlinking actually works.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/dfir\_mem\_dcom.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <code>psscan</code> plugin is used to enumerate running processes. It scans the memory pool tags associated with each process&#39;s <code>EPROCESS</code> structure. This technique can help identify processes that may have been hidden or unlinked by rootkits, as well as processes that have been terminated but have not been removed from memory yet. This plugin can be used as follows.</p>

<h3 id="memory-analysis-using-strings">Memory Analysis Using Strings</h3>
<p>Analyzing strings in memory dumps is a valuable technique in memory forensics and incident response. Strings often contain human-readable information, such as text messages, file paths, IP addresses, and even passwords.</p>
<p>We can either use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings">Strings</a> tool from the Sysinternals suite if our system is Windows-based, or the <code>strings</code> command from <code>Binutils</code>, if our system is Linux-based.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see some examples against a memory dump named <code>Win7-2515534d.vmem</code> that resides in the <code>/home/htb-student/MemoryDumps</code> directory of this section&#39;s target.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of common string searches during memory forensics and incident response. You can adapt and customize these searches based on your specific investigation&#39;s needs and the types of information you are looking for in the memory dump. Regular expressions can be powerful tools for pattern matching and data extraction during forensic analysis.</p>
<h2 id="disk-forensics">Disk Forensics</h2>
<p>As we&#39;ve previously highlighted, adhering to the sequence of data volatility is crucial. It&#39;s imperative that we scrutinize each byte to detect the subtle traces left by cyber adversaries. Having covered memory forensics, let&#39;s now shift our attention to the area of <code>disk forensics</code> (disk image examination and analysis).</p>
<p>Many disk forensic tools, both commercial and open-source, come packed with features. However, for incident response teams, certain functionalities stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>File Structure Insight</code>: Being able to navigate and see the disk&#39;s file hierarchy is crucial. Top-tier forensic tools should display this structure, allowing quick access to specific files, especially in known locations on a suspect system.</li>
<li><code>Hex Viewer</code>: For those moments when you need to get up close and personal with your data, viewing files in hexadecimal is essential. This capability is especially handy when dealing with threats like tailored malware or unique exploits.</li>
<li><code>Web Artifacts Analysis</code>: With so much user data tied to web activities, a forensic tool must efficiently sift through and present this data. It&#39;s a game-changer when you&#39;re piecing together events leading up to a user landing on a malicious website.</li>
<li><code>Email Carving</code>: Sometimes, the trail leads to internal threats. Maybe it&#39;s a rogue employee or just someone who slipped up. In such cases, emails often hold the key. A tool that can extract and present this data streamlines the process, making it easier to connect the dots.</li>
<li><code>Image Viewer</code>: At times, the images stored on systems can tell a story of their own. Whether it&#39;s for policy checks or deeper dives, having a built-in viewer is a boon.</li>
<li><code>Metadata Analysis</code>: Details like file creation timestamps, hashes, and disk location can be invaluable. Consider a scenario where you&#39;re trying to match the launch time of an app with a malware alert. Such correlations can be the linchpin in your investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.autopsy.com/">Autopsy</a>: a user-friendly forensic platform built atop the open-source Sleuth Kit toolset. It mirrors many features you&#39;d find in its commercial counterparts: timeline assessments, keyword hunts, web and email artifact retrievals, and the ability to sift results based on known malicious file hashes.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve loaded a forensic image and processed the data, you&#39;ll see the forensic artifacts neatly organized on the side panel. From here, you can:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image16.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Dive into <code>Data Sources</code> to explore files and directories. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image1\_.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Examine <code>Web Artifacts</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image80.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Check <code>Attached Devices</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image8\_.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Recover <code>Deleted Files</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image51.png" alt=""></li>
<li><p>Conduct <code>Keyword Searches</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image75.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image23.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>Keyword Lists</code> for targeted searches.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image52.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Undertake <code>Timeline Analysis</code> to map out events.

<p><strong>MAC(b) Times in NTFS</strong></p>
<p>The term <code>MAC(b) times</code> denotes a series of timestamps linked to files or objects. These timestamps are pivotal as they shed light on the chronology of events or actions on a file system. The acronym <code>MAC(b)</code> is an abbreviation for <code>Modified, Accessed, Changed, and (b) Birth</code> times. The inclusion of <code>b</code> signifies the <code>Birth timestamp</code>, which isn&#39;t universally present across all file systems or easily accessible via standard Windows API functions. Let&#39;s delve deeper into the nuances of <code>MACB</code> timestamps.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Modified Time (M)</code>: This timestamp captures the last instance when the content within the file underwent modifications. Any alterations to the file&#39;s data, such as content edits, trigger an update to this timestamp.</li>
<li><code>Accessed Time (A)</code>: This timestamp reflects the last occasion when the file was accessed or read, updating whenever the file is opened or otherwise engaged.</li>
<li><code>Changed [Change in MFT Record ] (C)</code>: This timestamp signifies changes to the MFT record. It captures the moment when the file was initially created. However, it&#39;s worth noting that certain file systems, like NTFS, might update this timestamp if the file undergoes movement or copying.</li>
<li><code>Birth Time (b)</code>: Often referred to as the Birth or Born timestamp, this represents the precise moment when the file or object was instantiated on the file system. Its significance in forensic investigations cannot be overstated, especially when determining a file&#39;s original creation time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Rules for Timestamps in the Windows NTFS File System</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>File Create</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Modified Timestamp (M)</code>: The Modified timestamp is updated to reflect the time of file creation.</li>
<li><code>Accessed Timestamp (A)</code>: The Accessed timestamp is updated to reflect that the file was accessed at the time of creation.</li>
<li><code>Birth (Created) Timestamp (b)</code>: The Birth timestamp is set to the time of file creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>File Modify</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Modified Timestamp (M)</code>: The Modified timestamp is updated to reflect the time when the file&#39;s content or attributes were last modified.</li>
<li><code>Accessed Timestamp (A)</code>: The Accessed timestamp is not updated when the file is modified.</li>
<li><code>Birth (Created) Timestamp (b)</code>: The Birth timestamp is not updated when the file is modified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>File Copy</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Modified Timestamp (M)</code>: The Modified timestamp is typically not updated when a file is copied. It usually inherits the timestamp from the source file.</li>
<li><code>Accessed Timestamp (A)</code>: The Accessed timestamp is updated to reflect that the file was accessed at the time of copying.</li>
<li><code>Birth (Created) Timestamp (b)</code>: The Birth timestamp is updated to the time of copying, indicating when the copy was created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>File Access</strong>:<ul>
<li><code>Modified Timestamp (M)</code>: The Modified timestamp is not updated when the file is accessed.</li>
<li><code>Accessed Timestamp (A)</code>: The Accessed timestamp is updated to reflect the time of access.</li>
<li><code>Birth (Created) Timestamp (b)</code>: The Birth timestamp is not updated when the file is accessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All these timestamps reside in the <code>$MFT</code> file, located at the root of the system drive. While the <code>$MFT</code> file will be covered in greater depth later, our current focus remains on understanding these timestamps.</p>
<p>These timestamps are housed within the <code>$MFT</code> across two distinct attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code></li>
<li><code>$FILE_NAME</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The timestamps visible in the Windows file explorer are derived from the <code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code> attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Timestomping Investigation</strong></p>
<p>Identifying instances of timestamp manipulation, commonly termed as timestomping (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/">T1070.006</a>), presents a formidable challenge in digital forensics. Timestomping entails the alteration of file timestamps to obfuscate the sequence of file activities. This tactic is frequently employed by various tools, as illustrated in the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK&#39;s timestomp technique.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_time3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When adversaries manipulate file creation times or deploy tools for such purposes, the timestamp displayed in the file explorer undergoes modification.</p>
<p>For instance, if we load <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$MFT</code> into <code>MFT Explorer</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6\MFTExplorer</code>) we will notice that the creation time of the file <code>ChangedFileTime.txt</code> has been tampered with, displaying <code>03-01-2022</code> in the file explorer, which deviates from the actual creation time.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>MFT Explorer</code> will take 15-25 minutes to load the file.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, given our knowledge that the timestamps in the file explorer originate from the <code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code> attribute, we can cross-verify this data with the timestamps from the <code>$FILE_NAME</code> attribute through <code>MFTEcmd</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6</code>) as follows.</p>

<p>In standard Windows file systems like NTFS, regular users typically lack the permissions to directly modify the timestamps of filenames in <code>$FILE_NAME</code>. Such modifications are exclusively within the purview of the system kernel.</p>
<p>To kickstart our exploration, let&#39;s first acquaint ourselves with filesystem-based artifacts. We&#39;ll commence with the <code>$MFT</code> file, nestled in the root directory of the KAPE output.</p>
<p><strong>MFT File</strong></p>
<p>The <code>$MFT</code> file, commonly referred to as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table">Master File Table</a>, is an integral part of the NTFS (New Technology File System) used by contemporary Windows operating systems. This file is instrumental in organizing and cataloging files and directories on an NTFS volume. Each file and directory on such a volume has a corresponding entry in the Master File Table. Think of the MFT as a comprehensive database, meticulously documenting metadata and structural details about every file and directory.</p>
<p>For those in the realm of digital forensics, the <code>$MFT</code> is a treasure trove of information. It offers a granular record of file and directory activities on the system, encompassing actions like file creation, modification, deletion, and access. By leveraging the <code>$MFT</code>, forensic analysts can piece together a detailed timeline of system events and user interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A standout feature of the MFT is its ability to retain metadata about files and directories, even post their deletion from the filesystem. This trait elevates the MFT&#39;s significance in forensic analysis and data recovery.</p>
<p>The MFT is strategically positioned at the root of the system drive.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already extracted the MFT while showcasing KAPE&#39;s capabilities and saved it at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$MFT</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s navigate to the <code>$MFT</code> file within the KAPE Output directory above and load it in <code>MFT Explorer</code>. This tool, one of Eric Zimmerman&#39;s masterpieces, empowers us to inspect and analyze the metadata nestled in the MFT. This encompasses a wealth of information about files and directories, from filenames and timestamps (created, modified, accessed) to file sizes, permissions, and attributes. A standout feature of the MFT Explorer is its intuitive interface, presenting file records in a graphical hierarchy reminiscent of the familiar Windows Explorer.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_exp1\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It&#39;s worth noting that MFT records, once created, aren&#39;t discarded. Instead, as new files and directories emerge, new records are added to the MFT. Records corresponding to deleted files are flagged as &quot;free&quot; and stand ready for reuse.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of MFT File Record</strong></p>
<p>Every file or directory on an NTFS volume is symbolized by a record in the MFT. These records adhere to a structured format, brimming with attributes and details about the associated file or directory. Grasping the MFT&#39;s structure is pivotal for tasks like forensic analysis, system management, and data recovery in Windows ecosystems. It equips forensic experts to pinpoint which attributes are brimming with intriguing insights.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_str1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a snapshot of the components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>File Record Header</code>: Contains metadata about the file record itself. Includes fields like signature, sequence number, and other administrative data.</li>
<li><code>Standard Information Attribute Header</code>: Stores standard file metadata such as timestamps, file attributes, and security identifiers.</li>
<li><code>File Name Attribute Header</code>: Contains information about the filename, including its length, namespace, and Unicode characters.</li>
<li><code>Data Attribute Header</code>: Describes the file data attribute, which can be either <code>resident</code> (stored within the MFT record) or <code>non-resident</code> (stored in external clusters).<ul>
<li><code>File Data (File content)</code>: This section holds the actual file data, which can be the file&#39;s content or references to non-resident data clusters. For small files (less than 512 bytes), the data might be stored within the MFT record (<code>resident</code>). For larger files, it references <code>non-resident</code> data clusters on the disk. We&#39;ll see an example of this later on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Additional Attributes (optional)</code>: NTFS supports various additional attributes, such as security descriptors (SD), object IDs (OID), volume name (VOLNAME), index information, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>These attributes can vary depending on the file&#39;s characteristics. We can see the common type of information which is stored inside these header and attributes in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_str2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>File Record Header</strong></p>
<p>Contains metadata about the file record itself. Includes fields like signature, sequence number, and other administrative data.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_str3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The file record begins with a header that contains metadata about the file record itself. This header typically includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Signature</code>: A four-byte signature, usually &quot;FILE&quot; or &quot;BAAD,&quot; indicating whether the record is in use or has been deallocated.</li>
<li><code>Offset to Update Sequence Array</code>: An offset to the Update Sequence Array (USA) that helps maintain the integrity of the record during updates.</li>
<li><code>Size of Update Sequence Array</code>: The size of the Update Sequence Array in words.</li>
<li><code>Log File Sequence Number</code>: A number that identifies the last update to the file record.</li>
<li><code>Sequence Number</code>: A number identifying the file record. The MFT records are numbered sequentially, starting from 0.</li>
<li><code>Hard Link Count</code>: The number of hard links to the file. This indicates how many directory entries point to this file record.</li>
<li><code>Offset to First Attribute</code>: An offset to the first attribute in the file record.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we sift through the MFT file using <code>MFTECmd</code> and extract details about a record, the information from the file record is presented as depicted in the subsequent screenshot.</p>

<p>To demystify the structure of an NTFS MFT file record, we&#39;re harnessing the capabilities of <a href="https://www.disk-editor.org/index.html">Active@ Disk Editor</a>. This potent, freeware disk editing tool is available at <code>C:\Program Files\LSoft Technologies\Active@ Disk Editor</code> and facilitates the viewing and modification of raw disk data, including the Master File Table of an NTFS system. The same insights can be gleaned from other MFT parsing tools, such as <code>MFT Explorer</code>.</p>
<p>We can have a closer look by opening <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$MFT</code> on <code>Active@ Disk Editor</code> and then pressing <code>Inspect File Record</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Disk Editor, we&#39;re privy to the raw data of MFT entries. This includes a hexadecimal representation of the MFT record, complete with its header and attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Resident Flag</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_str4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When parsing the entry in <code>MFTECmd</code>, this is how the non-resident data header appears.</p>

<p><strong>Resident Flag</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_mft\_str5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When parsing the entry in <code>MFTECmd</code>, this is how the resident data header appears.</p>

<p><strong>Zone.Identifier data in MFT File Record</strong></p>
<p>The <code>Zone.Identifier</code> is a specialized file metadata attribute in the Windows OS, signifying the security zone from which a file was sourced. It&#39;s an integral part of the Windows Attachment Execution Service (AES) and is instrumental in determining how Windows processes files procured from the internet or other potentially untrusted origins.</p>
<p>When a file is fetched from the internet, Windows assigns it a Zone Identifier (<code>ZoneId</code>). This ZoneId, embedded in the file&#39;s metadata, signifies the source or security zone of the file&#39;s origin. For instance, internet-sourced files typically bear a <code>ZoneId</code> of <code>3</code>, denoting the Internet Zone.</p>
<p>For instance, we downloaded various tools inside the <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Downloads</code> directory of this section&#39;s target. Post-download, a <code>ZoneID</code> replete with the Zone.Identifier (i.e., the source URL) has been assigned to them.</p>

<p>One of the security mechanisms, known as the <code>Mark of the Web</code> (<code>MotW</code>), hinges on the Zone Identifier. Here, the MotW marker differentiates files sourced from the internet or other potentially dubious sources from those originating from trusted or local contexts. It&#39;s frequently employed to bolster the security of applications like Microsoft Word. When an app, say Microsoft Word, opens a file bearing a MotW, it can institute specific security measures based on the MotW&#39;s presence. For instance, a Word document with a MotW might be launched in <code>Protected View</code>, a restricted mode that isolates the document from the broader system, mitigating potential security threats.</p>
<p>While its primary function is to bolster security for files downloaded from the web, forensic analysts can harness it for investigative pursuits. By scrutinizing this attribute, they can ascertain the file&#39;s download method. See an example below.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing with Timeline Explorer</strong></p>
<p><code>Timeline Explorer</code> is another digital forensic tool developed by Eric Zimmerman which is used to assist forensic analysts and investigators in creating and analyzing timeline artifacts from various sources. Timeline artifacts provide a chronological view of system events and activities, making it easier to reconstruct a sequence of events during an investigation. We can filter timeline data based on specific criteria, such as date and time ranges, event types, keywords, and more. This feature helps focus the investigation on relevant information.</p>
<p>This arrangement of different events following one after another in time is really useful to create a story or timeline about what happened before and after specific events. This sequencing of events helps establish a timeline of activities on a system.</p>
<p>Loading a converted CSV file into Timeline Explorer is a straightforward process. Timeline Explorer is designed to work with timeline data, including CSV files that contain timestamped events or activities. To load the event data csv file into the Timeline Explorer, we can launch Timeline Explorer, and simply drag and drop from its location (e.g., our KAPE analysis directory) onto the Timeline Explorer window.</p>
<p>Once ingested, Timeline Explorer will process and display the data. The duration of this process hinges on the file&#39;s size.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_winevt8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We will see the timeline populated with the events from the CSV file in chronological order. With the timeline data now loaded, we can explore and analyze the events using the various features provided by Timeline Explorer. We can zoom in on specific time ranges, filter events, search for keywords, and correlate related activities.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_winevt9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We will provide multiple examples of using Timeline Explorer in this section.</p>
<p><strong>USN Journal</strong></p>
<p><code>USN</code>, or <code>Update Sequence Number</code>, is a vital component of the NTFS file system in Windows. The USN Journal is essentially a change journal feature that meticulously logs alterations to files and directories on an NTFS volume.</p>
<p>For those in digital forensics, the USN Journal is a goldmine. It enables us to monitor operations such as File Creation, Rename, Deletion, and Data Overwrite.</p>
<p>In the Windows environment, the USN Journal file is designated as <code>$J</code>. The KAPE Output directory houses the collected USN Journal in the following directory: <code>&lt;KAPE_output_folder&gt;\&lt;Drive&gt;\$Extend</code></p>
<p>Here is how it looks in our KAPE&#39;s output (<code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$Extend</code>)</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img5.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Analyzing the USN Journal Using MFTECmd</strong></p>
<p>We previously utilized <code>MFTECmd</code>, one of Eric Zimmerman&#39;s tools, to parse the MFT file. While its primary focus is the MFT, MFTECmd can also be instrumental in analyzing the USN Journal. This is because entries in the USN Journal often allude to modifications to files and directories that are documented in the MFT. Hence, we&#39;ll employ this tool to dissect the USN Journal.</p>
<p>To facilitate the analysis of the USN Journal using <code>MFTECmd</code>, execute a command akin to the one below:</p>

<p>Upon inspection, we can discern a chronologically ordered timeline of events. Notably, the entry for <code>uninstall.exe</code> is evident.</p>
<p>By applying a filter on the Entry Number <code>93866</code>, which corresponds to the <code>Entry ID</code> for <code>uninstall.exe</code>, we can glean the nature of modifications executed on this specific file.</p>

<p>The file extension, <code>.crdownload</code>, is indicative of a partially downloaded file. This type of file is typically generated when downloading content via browsers like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Chromium. This revelation is intriguing. If the file was downloaded via a browser, it&#39;s plausible that the <code>Zone.Identifier</code> could unveil the source IP/domain of its origin.</p>
<p>To investigate this assumption we should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a CSV file for <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$MFT</code> using <code>MFTECmd</code> as we did for <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\$Extend\$J</code>.</li>

<p><strong>Windows Event Logs Investigation</strong></p>
<p>Probing into Windows Event Logs is paramount in digital forensics and incident response. These logs are repositories of invaluable data, chronicling system activities, user behaviors, and security incidents on a Windows machine. When KAPE is executed, it duplicates the original event logs, ensuring their pristine state is preserved as evidence. The KAPE Output directory houses these event logs in the following directory: <code>&lt;KAPE_output_folder&gt;\Windows\System32\winevt\logs</code></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This directory is populated with <code>.evtx</code> files, encapsulating a myriad of windows event logs, including but not limited to Security, Application, System, and Sysmon (if activated).</p>
<p>Our mission is to sift through these event logs, on the hunt for any anomalies, patterns, or indicators of compromise (IOCs). As forensic sleuths, we should be vigilant, paying heed to event IDs, timestamps, source IPs, usernames, and other pertinent log details. A plethora of forensic utilities and scripts, such as log parsing tools and SIEM systems, can bolster our analysis. It&#39;s imperative to identify the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) evident in any dubious activity. This might entail delving into known attack patterns and malware signatures. Another crucial step is to correlate events from diverse log sources, crafting a comprehensive timeline of events. This holistic view aids in piecing together the sequence of events.</p>
<p>The analysis of Windows Event Logs has been addressed in the modules titled <code>Windows Event Logs &amp; Finding Evil</code> and <code>YARA &amp; Sigma for SOC Analysts</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Event Logs Parsing Using EvtxECmd (EZ-Tool)</strong></p>
<p><code>EvtxECmd</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6\EvtxeCmd</code>) is another brainchild of Eric Zimmerman, tailored for Windows Event Log files (EVTX files). With this tool at our disposal, we can extract specific event logs or a range of events from an EVTX file, converting them into more digestible formats like JSON, XML, or CSV.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s initiate the help menu of EvtxECmd to familiarize ourselves with the various options. The command to access the help section is as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Maps in EvtxECmd</strong></p>
<p>Maps in <code>EvtxECmd</code> are pivotal. They metamorphose customized data into standardized fields in the CSV (and JSON) data. This granularity and precision are indispensable in forensic investigations, enabling analysts to interpret and extract salient information from Windows Event Logs with finesse.</p>
<p>Standardized fields in maps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UserName</code>: Contains information about user and/or domain found in various event logs</li>
<li><code>ExecutableInfo</code>: Contains information about process command line, scheduled tasks etc.</li>
<li><code>PayloadData1,2,3,4,5,6</code>: Additional fields to extract and put contextual data from event logs</li>
<li><code>RemoteHost</code>: Contains information about IP address</li>
</ul>
<p><code>EvtxECmd</code> plays a significant role in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting the unique part of an event, known as EventData, into a more standardized and human-readable format.</li>
<li>Ensuring that the map files are tailored to specific event logs, such as Security, Application, or custom logs, to handle differences in event structures and data.</li>
<li>Using a unique identifier, the Channel element, to specify which event log a particular map file is designed for, preventing confusion when event IDs are reused across different logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure the most recent maps are in place before converting the EVTX files to CSV/JSON, employ the command below.</p>

<p>With the latest maps integrated, we&#39;re equipped to infuse contextual information into distinct fields, streamlining the log analysis process. Now, it&#39;s time to transmute the logs into a format that&#39;s more palatable.</p>
<p>To render the EVTX files more accessible, we can employ <code>EvtxECmd</code> to seamlessly convert event log files into user-friendly formats like JSON or CSV.</p>
<p>For instance, the command below facilitates the conversion of the <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx</code> file to a CSV file:</p>

<p><strong>Investigating Windows Event Logs with EQL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/endgameinc/eqllib">Endgame&#39;s Event Query Language (EQL)</a> is an indispensable tool for sifting through event logs, pinpointing potential security threats, and uncovering suspicious activities on Windows systems. EQL offers a structured language that facilitates querying and correlating events across multiple log sources, including the Windows Event Logs.</p>
<p>Currently, the EQL module is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.5+. If you have a supported Python version installed, execute the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cmd-session">C:\Users\<span class="hljs-keyword">johndoe&gt;pip </span><span class="hljs-keyword">install </span>eql
</code></pre>
<p>Should Python be properly configured and included in your PATH, eql should be accessible. To verify this, execute the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cmd-session"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">C</span>:\<span class="hljs-selector-tag">Users</span>\<span class="hljs-selector-tag">johndoe</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-selector-tag">eql</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">--version</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">eql</span> 0<span class="hljs-selector-class">.9</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.18</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Within EQL&#39;s repository (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\eqllib-master</code>), there&#39;s a PowerShell module brimming with essential functions tailored for parsing Sysmon events from Windows Event Logs. This module resides in the <code>utils</code> directory of <code>eqllib</code>, and is named <code>scrape-events.ps1</code>.</p>
<p>From the EQL directory, initiate the scrape-events.ps1 module with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell-session">PS C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\e</span>qllib-master<span class="hljs-symbol">\u</span>tils&gt; import-module .<span class="hljs-symbol">\s</span>crape-events.ps1
</code></pre>
<p>By doing so, we activate the <code>Get-EventProps</code> function, which is instrumental in parsing event properties from Sysmon logs. To transform, for example, <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx</code> into a JSON format suitable for EQL queries, execute the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell-session">PS C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\e</span>qllib-master<span class="hljs-symbol">\u</span>tils&gt; Get-WinEvent -Path C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\f</span>orensic_data<span class="hljs-symbol">\k</span>ape_output<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span><span class="hljs-symbol">\W</span>indows<span class="hljs-symbol">\S</span>ystem32<span class="hljs-symbol">\w</span>inevt<span class="hljs-symbol">\l</span>ogs<span class="hljs-symbol">\M</span>icrosoft-Windows-Sysmon<span class="hljs-variable">%4Operational.evtx -Oldest | Get-EventProps | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -FilePath C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\event_logs\eql_format_json\eql-sysmon-data-kape.json</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This action will yield a JSON file, primed for EQL queries.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s now see how we could have identified user/group enumeration through an EQL query against the JSON file we created.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cmd-session">C:\Users\johndoe&gt;eql query -<span class="hljs-keyword">f</span> C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\event_logs\eql_format_json\eql-sysmon-data-kape.json <span class="hljs-string">"EventId=1 and (Image='*net.exe' and (wildcard(CommandLine, '* user*', '*localgroup *', '*group *')))"</span>

<p>Registry-related files harvested from KAPE are typically housed in <code>&lt;KAPE_output_folder&gt;\Windows\System32\config</code></p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, there are user-specific registry hives located within individual user directories, as exemplified in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_registry1\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For a comprehensive analysis, we can employ <code>Registry Explorer</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6\RegistryExplorer</code>) a GUI-based tool masterminded by Eric Zimmerman. This tool offers a streamlined interface to navigate and dissect the contents of Windows Registry hives. By simply dragging and dropping these files into Registry Explorer, the tool processes the data, presenting it within its GUI. The left panel displays the registry hives, while the right panel reveals their corresponding values.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below we have loaded the <code>SYSTEM</code> hive, that can be found inside the <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\config</code> directory of this section&#39;s target.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Registry Explorer boasts a suite of features, including hive analysis, search capabilities, filtering options, timestamp viewing, and bookmarking. The bookmarking utility is particularly handy, allowing users to earmark pivotal locations or keys for subsequent reference.</p>
<p>In the screenshot below we have loaded the <code>SOFTWARE</code> hive, that can be found inside the <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\config</code> directory of this section&#39;s target. Notice the available bookmarks within Registry Explorer.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img12.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>RegRipper</strong></p>
<p>Another potent tool in our arsenal is <code>RegRipper</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\RegRipper3.0-master</code>), a command-line utility adept at swiftly extracting information from the Registry.</p>
<p>To acquaint ourselves with RegRipper&#39;s functionalities, let&#39;s invoke the help section by executing <code>rip.exe</code> accompanied by the <code>-h</code> parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell-session">PS C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\RegRipper3<span class="hljs-number">.0</span>-master&gt; .\rip.exe -h
Rip v<span class="hljs-number">.3</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span> - CLI RegRipper tool
Rip [-r Reg hive file] [-f profile] [-p plugin] [options]
Parse Windows Registry files, using either a single <span class="hljs-keyword">module</span>, or a profile.

NOTE: This tool does NOT automatically process Registry transaction logs! The tool
does check to see <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the hive is dirty, but does not automatically process the
transaction logs.  If you need to incorporate transaction logs, please consider
using yarp + registryFlush.py, or rla.exe <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> Eric Zimmerman.

  -r [hive] .........Registry hive file to parse
  -d ................Check to see <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the hive is dirty
  -g ................Guess the hive file type
  -a ................Automatically run hive-specific plugins
  -aT ...............Automatically run hive-specific TLN plugins
  -f [profile].......use the profile
  -p [plugin]........use the plugin
  -l ................list all plugins
  -c ................Output plugin list <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> CSV format (use <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> -l)
  -s systemname......<span class="hljs-keyword">system</span> name (TLN support)
  -u username........User name (TLN support)
  -uP ...............Update default profiles
  -h.................Help (print this information)

Ex: C:\&gt;rip -r c:\<span class="hljs-keyword">case</span>\<span class="hljs-keyword">system</span> -f <span class="hljs-keyword">system</span>
    C:\&gt;rip -r c:\<span class="hljs-keyword">case</span>\ntuser.dat -p userassist
    C:\&gt;rip -r c:\<span class="hljs-keyword">case</span>\ntuser.dat -a
    C:\&gt;rip -l -c

All output goes to STDOUT; use redirection (ie, &gt; or &gt;&gt;) to output to a file.

<p>For a seamless experience with RegRipper, it&#39;s essential to familiarize ourselves with its plugins. To enumerate all available plugins and catalog them in a CSV file (e.g., <code>rip_plugins.csv</code>), use the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell-session">PS C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\R</span>egRipper3.0-master&gt; .<span class="hljs-symbol">\r</span>ip.exe -l -c &gt; rip_plugins.csv
</code></pre>
<p>This action compiles a comprehensive list of plugins, detailing the associated hives, and saves it as a CSV file.</p>
<p>The screenshot below elucidates the contents of this file, highlighting the plugin name, its corresponding registry hive, and a brief description.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_regripper\_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To kick things off, let&#39;s execute the <code>compname</code> command on the SYSTEM hive (located at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\config</code>), which retrieves the computer&#39;s name.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell-session">PS C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\R</span>egRipper3.0-master&gt; .<span class="hljs-symbol">\r</span>ip.exe -r "C:<span class="hljs-symbol">\U</span>sers<span class="hljs-symbol">\j</span>ohndoe<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span>esktop<span class="hljs-symbol">\f</span>orensic_data<span class="hljs-symbol">\k</span>ape_output<span class="hljs-symbol">\D</span><span class="hljs-symbol">\W</span>indows<span class="hljs-symbol">\S</span>ystem32<span class="hljs-symbol">\c</span>onfig<span class="hljs-symbol">\S</span>YSTEM" -p compname

<p><strong>Program Execution Artifacts</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about <code>execution artifacts</code> in digital forensics, we&#39;re referring to the traces and evidence left behind on a computer system or device when a program runs. These little bits of information can clue us in on the activities and behaviors of software, users, and even those with malicious intent. If we want to piece together what went down on a computer, diving into these execution artifacts is a must.</p>
<p>You might stumble upon some well-known execution artifacts in these Windows components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Prefetch</code></li>
<li><code>ShimCache</code></li>
<li><code>Amcache</code></li>
<li><code>BAM (Background Activity Moderator)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s dive deeper into each of these to get a better grasp on the kind of program execution details they capture.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation of Prefetch</strong></p>
<p><code>Prefetch</code> is a Windows operating system feature that helps optimize the loading of applications by preloading certain components and data. Prefetch files are created for every program that is executed on a Windows system, and this includes both installed applications and standalone executables. The naming convention of Prefetch files is indeed based on the original name of the executable file, followed by a hexadecimal value of the path where the executable file resides, and it ends with the <code>.pf</code> file extension.</p>
<p>In digital forensics, the Prefetch folder and associated files can provide valuable insights into the applications that have been executed on a Windows system. Forensic analysts can examine Prefetch files to determine which applications have been run, how often they were executed, and when they were last run.</p>
<p>In general, prefetch files are stored in the <code>C:\Windows\Prefetch\</code> directory.</p>
<p>Prefetch-related files harvested from KAPE are typically housed in <code>&lt;KAPE_output_folder&gt;\Windows\prefetch</code>.</p>

<p>Eric Zimmerman provides a tool for prefetch files: <code>PECmd</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6</code>).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to launch PECmd&#39;s help menu from the EricZimmerman tools directory.</p>

<p>PECmd will analyze the prefetch file (<code>.pf</code>) and display various information about the application execution. This generally includes details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and last execution timestamps.</li>
<li>Number of times the application has been executed.</li>
<li>Volume and directory information.</li>
<li>Application name and path.</li>
<li>File information, such as file size and hash values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see by providing a path to a single prefetch file, for example the prefetch file related to <code>discord.exe</code> (i.e. DISCORD.EXE-7191FAD6.pf located at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\prefetch</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Investigation of ShimCache (Application Compatibility Cache)</strong></p>
<p><code>ShimCache</code> (also known as AppCompatCache) is a Windows mechanism used by the Windows operating systems in order to identify application compatibility issues. This database records information about executed applications, and is stored in the Windows Registry. This information can be used by developers to track compatibility issues with executed programs.</p>
<p>In the <code>AppCompatCache</code> cache entries, we can see the information such as:</p>
<ul>

<p>The <code>AppCompatCache</code> key is located at the <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\ControlSet001\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache</code> registry location.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s load the <code>SYSTEM</code> registry hive (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\System32\config</code>) in <code>Registry Explorer</code> and see what kind of information it contains. We can do that by opening Registry Explorer and dropping the registry hive files into it. Then we will need to go to bookmarks and select <code>AppCompatCache</code>. In the bottom right side, we should see the evidence of application execution as shown in the screenshot.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation of Amcache</strong></p>
<p><code>AmCache</code> refers to a Windows registry file which is used to store evidence related to program execution. It serves as a valuable resource for digital forensics and security investigations, helping analysts understand the history of application execution and detect signs of any suspicious execution.</p>
<p>The information that it contains include the execution path, first executed time, deleted time, and first installation. It also provides the file hash for the executables.</p>
<p>On Windows OS the AmCache hive is located at <code>C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\AmCache.hve</code></p>
<p>AmCache-related files harvested from KAPE are typically housed in <code>&lt;KAPE_output_folder&gt;\Windows\AppCompat\Programs</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s load <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\kape_output\D\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\AmCache.hve</code> in Registry Explorer to see what kind of information it contains.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation of Windows BAM (Background Activity Moderator)</strong></p>
<p>The <code>Background Activity Moderator</code> (BAM) is a component in the Windows operating system that tracks and logs the execution of certain types of background or scheduled tasks. BAM is actually a kernel device driver as shown in the below screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_bamdrv.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is primarily responsible for controlling the activity of background applications but it can help us in providing the evidence of program execution which it lists under the bam registry hive. The BAM key is located at the below registry location. <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\{USER-SID}</code></p>
<p>Using Registry Explorer, we can browse this inside the SYSTEM hive to see the executable names. Registry explorer already has a bookmark for <code>bam</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/img15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also use <code>RegRipper</code> to get similar information through its <code>bam</code> plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing Captured API Call Data (<code>.apmx64</code>)</strong></p>
<p><code>.apmx64</code> files are generated by <a href="http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor">API Monitor</a>, which records API call data. These files can be opened and analyzed within the tool itself. API Monitor is a software that captures and displays API calls initiated by applications and services. While its primary function is debugging and monitoring, its capability to capture API call data makes it handy for uncovering forensic artifacts. Let&#39;s proceed by loading <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\forensic_data\APMX64\discord.apmx64</code> into API Monitor (available at <code>C:\Program Files\rohitab.com\API Monitor</code>) and examining its contents for valuable information.</p>
<p>Launching the API Monitor will initiate certain necessary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon opening the API Monitor application, let&#39;s head over to the <code>File</code> menu and choose <code>Open</code> From there, let&#39;s navigate to the location of the <code>.apmx64</code> file and select it.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After opening the file, a list of recorded API calls made by the monitored application will be displayed. Typically, this list contains details such as the API function name, parameters, return values, and timestamps. The screenshot below offers a comprehensive view of the API Monitor user interface and its various sections.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon3\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Clicking on the monitored processes to the left will display the recorded API call data for the chosen process in the summary view to the right. For illustration, consider selecting the <code>discord.exe</code> process. In the summary view, we will observe the API calls initiated by <code>discord.exe</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A notable observation from the screenshot is the call to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-wgetenv?view=msvc-170">getenv function</a>. Here&#39;s the syntax of this function.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell-session"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> *<span class="hljs-title">getenv</span><span class="hljs-params">(
   <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> *varname
)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<p>This function retrieves the value of a specified environment variable. It requires a <code>varname</code> parameter, representing a valid environment variable name, and returns a pointer pointing to the table entry containing the respective environment variable&#39;s value.</p>
<p>API Monitor boasts a plethora of filtering and search capabilities. This allows us to hone in on specific API calls based on functions or time frames. By browsing through the summary or utilizing the filter and search functionalities, we can unearth intriguing details, such as API calls concerning file creation, process creation, registry alterations, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Registry Persistence via Run Keys</strong></p>
<p>An oft-employed strategy by adversaries to maintain unauthorized access to a compromised system is inserting an entry into the <code>run keys</code> within the Windows Registry. Let&#39;s investigate if there&#39;s any reference to the <code>RegOpenKeyExA</code> function, which accesses the designated registry key. To perform this search, simply type <code>RegOpenKey</code> into the search box, usually situated atop the API Monitor window, and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the displayed results, it&#39;s evident that the registry key <code>SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code> corresponds to the Run registry key, which triggers the designated program upon every user login. Malicious entities often exploit this key to embed entries pointing to their backdoor, a task achievable via the registry API function <code>RegSetValueExA</code>.</p>
<p>To explore further, let&#39;s seek any mention of the <code>RegSetValueExA</code> function, which defines data and type for a specified value within a registry key. Engage the search box, type <code>RegSet</code>, and hit <code>Enter</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A notable observation is the <code>RegSetValueExA</code> invocation. Before diving deeper, let&#39;s familiarize ourselves with this function&#39;s documentation.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell-session">LSTATUS RegSetValueExA(
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]           HKEY       hKey,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, optional] LPCSTR     lpValueName,
                 <span class="hljs-built_in">DWORD</span>      Reserved,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]           <span class="hljs-built_in">DWORD</span>      dwType,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]           const <span class="hljs-built_in">BYTE</span> *lpData,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]           <span class="hljs-built_in">DWORD</span>      cbData
)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>hKey1</code> is a handle to the registry key where you want to set a registry value.</li>
<li><code>lpValueName</code> is a pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the registry value you want to set. In this case, it is named as <code>DiscordUpdate</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>Reserved</code> parameter is reserved and must be zero.</li>
<li><code>dwType</code> specifies the data type of the registry value. It&#39;s likely an integer constant that represents the data type (e.g., <code>REG_SZ</code> for a string value).</li>
<li><code>(BYTE*)lpData</code> is a type cast that converts the <code>_lpData_</code> variable to a pointer to a byte (<code>BYTE*</code>). This is done to ensure that the data pointed to by <code>_lpData_</code> is treated as a byte array, which is the expected format for binary data in the Windows Registry. In our case, this is shown in the buffer view as <code>C:\Windows\Tasks\update.exe</code>.</li>
<li><code>cbData</code> is an integer that specifies the size, in bytes, of the data pointed to by <code>_lpData_</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A critical takeaway from this API call is the <code>lpData</code> parameter, which reveals the backdoor&#39;s location, <code>C:\Windows\Tasks\update.exe</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Process Injection</strong></p>
<p>To scrutinize process creation, let&#39;s search for the <code>CreateProcessA</code> function. Let&#39;s key in <code>CreateProcess</code> in the search box and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_apimon5\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Presented below is the syntax of the Windows API function, <code>CreateProcessA</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell-session">BOOL CreateProcessA(
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>]      LPCSTR                lpApplicationName,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">out</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>] LPSTR                 lpCommandLine,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]                BOOL                  bInheritHandles,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]                DWORD                 dwCreationFlags,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>]      LPVOID                lpEnvironment,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">optional</span>]      LPCSTR                lpCurrentDirectory,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>]                LPSTARTUPINFOA        lpStartupInfo,
  [<span class="hljs-keyword">out</span>]               LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation
);
</code></pre>
<p>An intriguing element within this API is the <code>lpCommandLine</code> parameter. It discloses the executed command line, which, in this context, is <code>C:\Windows\System32\comp.exe</code>. Notably, the <code>lpCommandLine</code> can be specified without delineating the complete executable path in the <code>lpApplicationName</code> value.</p>
<p>Another pivotal parameter worth noting is <code>dwCreationFlags</code>, set to <code>CREATE_SUSPENDED</code>. This indicates that the new process&#39;s primary thread starts in a suspended state and remains inactive until the <code>ResumeThread</code> function gets invoked.</p>
<p>The <code>lpCommandLine</code> parameter of this API call sheds light on the child process that was initiated, namely, <code>C:\Windows\System32\comp.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Further down we also notice process injection-related functions being utilized by <code>discord.exe</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/disc\_inj.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All the above are strong indicators of process injection.</p>
<p><strong>PowerShell Activity</strong></p>
<p>PowerShell transcripts meticulously log both the commands issued and their respective outputs during a PowerShell session. Occasionally, within a user&#39;s documents directory, we might stumble upon PowerShell transcript files. These files grant us a window into the recorded PowerShell activities on the system.</p>
<p>The subsequent screenshot, showcases the PowerShell transcript files nestled within the user&#39;s documents directory on a mounted forensic image.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/win\_dfir\_accessdata\_ps1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Reviewing PowerShell-related activity in detail can be instrumental during investigations.</p>
<p>Here are some recommended guidelines when handling PowerShell data.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Unusual Commands</code>: Look for PowerShell commands that are not typical in your environment or are commonly associated with malicious activities. For example, commands to download files from the internet (Invoke-WebRequest or wget), commands that manipulate the registry, or those that involve creating scheduled tasks.</li>
<li><code>Script Execution</code>: Check for the execution of PowerShell scripts, especially if they are not signed or come from untrusted sources. Scripts can be used to automate malicious actions.</li>
<li>Encoded Commands: Malicious actors often use encoded or obfuscated PowerShell commands to evade detection. Look for signs of encoded commands in transcripts.</li>
<li><code>Privilege Escalation</code>: Commands that attempt to escalate privileges, change user permissions, or perform actions typically restricted to administrators can be suspicious.</li>
<li><code>File Operations</code>: Check for PowerShell commands that involve creating, moving, or deleting files, especially in sensitive system locations.</li>
<li><code>Network Activity</code>: Look for commands related to network activity, such as making HTTP requests or initiating network connections. These may be indicative of command and control (C2) communications.</li>
<li><code>Registry Manipulation</code>: Check for commands that involve modifying the Windows Registry, as this can be a common tactic for malware persistence.</li>
<li><code>Use of Uncommon Modules</code>: If a PowerShell script or command uses uncommon or non-standard modules, it could be a sign of suspicious activity.</li>
<li><code>User Account Activity</code>: Look for changes to user accounts, including creation, modification, or deletion. Malicious actors may attempt to create or manipulate user accounts for persistence.</li>
<li><code>Scheduled Tasks</code>: Investigate the creation or modification of scheduled tasks through PowerShell. This can be a common method for persistence.</li>
<li><code>Repeated or Unusual Patterns</code>: Analyze the patterns of PowerShell commands. Repeated, identical commands or unusual sequences of commands may indicate automation or malicious behavior.</li>
<li><code>Execution of Unsigned Scripts</code>: The execution of unsigned scripts can be a sign of suspicious activity, especially if script execution policies are set to restrict this.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p>When a process allocates a memory page with <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code> permissions, it&#39;s essentially requesting the ability to both execute and write to that memory region. In layman&#39;s terms, the process is saying, &quot;I want to be able to run code from here, but I also want the flexibility to change what that code is on the fly.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, why does that raise eyebrows? Well, legitimate applications typically segregate the tasks of code execution and data writing. They&#39;ll have specific regions of memory for running code (executable) and separate regions where data is written or modified. This separation is a fundamental security principle, ensuring that data isn&#39;t inadvertently executed or that executable regions aren&#39;t tampered with unexpectedly.</p>
<p>However, many types of malware, especially those that employ code injection techniques, require the ability to write their payload into memory and then execute it. By allocating memory with <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code> permissions, they can write and subsequently execute malicious code within the same memory region, making their malicious activities more streamlined and efficient.</p>
<p>In essence, while not every instance of <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code> is malicious, its presence is a strong indicator of potential malfeasance, and it&#39;s something we, as vigilant security analysts, should scrutinize closely.</p>

<p>We notice <code>E:\payload.dll</code> in Volatility&#39;s output. Based on its location, we surmise it could originate from an external USB or perhaps a mounted ISO file. We&#39;ll earmark this DLL for a more in-depth analysis later on.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Handles</strong></p>
<p>Next, let&#39;s identify the files and registry entries accessed by the suspicious process using Volatility&#39;s <code>windows.handles</code> plugin.</p>
<p>When a process needs to read from or write to a file, it doesn&#39;t directly interact with the file&#39;s data on the disk. Instead, the process requests the operating system to open the file, and in return, the OS provides a file handle. This handle is essentially a ticket that grants the process permission to perform operations on that file. Every subsequent operation the process performs on that file - be it reading, writing, or closing - is done through this handle.</p>
<p>Open handles can be a goldmine for forensic analysts. By examining the list of open handles, we can determine which processes were accessing which files or registry keys at a particular point in time. This can provide insights into the behavior of potentially malicious software or the actions of a user.</p>

<h3 id="disk-image-rapid-triage-data-examination-analysis">Disk Image/Rapid Triage Data Examination &amp; Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Searching for Keywords with Autopsy</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s first open <code>Autopsy</code> and access the case from <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\MalwareAttack</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to trace <code>payload.dll</code> on the disk, we&#39;ll navigate through <code>Autopsy</code> and initiate a search for the <code>payload.dll</code> keyword, prioritizing results by their creation time.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image78.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the 29 findings, the <code>Finance08062023.iso</code> file in the <code>Downloads</code> directory should pique our interest (recall the DLL on the <code>E</code> drive?). We can extract this file for subsequent scrutiny, by right-clicking and selecting <code>Extract File(s)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image32.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Given the file&#39;s presence in the <code>Downloads</code> folder and a corresponding <code>Chrome cache file</code> (<code>f_000003</code>) pointing to similar strings, it&#39;s plausible that the <code>ISO</code> file was fetched via a browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image57.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Identifying Web Download Information &amp; Extracting Files with Autopsy</strong></p>
<p>To extract web download details, we&#39;ll harness the capabilities of <code>ADS</code>. Within <code>Autopsy</code>, we can access the <code>Downloads</code> directory to locate our file. Here, the <code>.Zone.Identifier</code> information, courtesy of the <code>Alternate Data Stream (ADS)</code> file attributes, is invaluable.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image87.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This identifier reveals the file&#39;s internet origin, and we can pinpoint the <code>HostUrl</code> from which the malicious <code>ISO</code> was sourced.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Corroborating our findings, <code>Autopsy</code>&#39;s <code>Web Downloads</code> artifacts confirm that <code>Finance08062023.iso</code> was sourced from <code>letsgohunt[.]site</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image9\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon mounting the extracted <code>ISO</code> file, we notice that it houses both a <code>DLL</code> and a shortcut file, which leverages <code>rundll32.exe</code> to activate <code>payload.dll</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying Persistence with Autoruns</strong></p>
<p>For persistence mechanisms, let&#39;s inspect the <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\files\johndoe_autoruns.arn</code> file using the <code>Autoruns</code> tool.</p>
<p>Within the <code>Logon</code> section, we notice a <code>LocalSystem</code> entry with the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registry path</strong>: <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code></li>
<li><strong>Image path</strong>: <code>C:\ProgramData\svchost.exe</code></li>

<p><strong>Analyzing MFT Data with Autopsy</strong></p>
<p>While using the Autoruns tool to search for persistence, we came across the image path <code>C:\ProgramData\svchost.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s dive into <code>C:\ProgramData</code> using Autopsy to find this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image54.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Can you spot any irregularities? Timestomping is a crafty technique where adversaries modify a file&#39;s timestamps to blend in with surrounding files, making detection challenging for forensic tools and investigators. By accessing the file&#39;s metadata (<code>File Metadata</code> tab), we can pinpoint the <code>MFT (Master File Table) attributes</code>, which will reveal the genuine modification date.</p>
<p>Notably, there&#39;s a discrepancy when contrasting the <code>$FILE_NAME</code> <code>MFT Modified</code> value with the <code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code> <code>File Modified</code> value.</p>
<p>The <code>$STANDARD_INFORMATION</code> <code>File Modified</code> timestamp is what a user typically encounters when viewing file properties. This could lead someone to believe that the file has been present for a while and might be unrelated to any recent activity. However, <code>$FILE_NAME</code> <code>MFT Modified</code> holds the authentic timestamp, revealing the file&#39;s actual history.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image5\_\_.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Analyzing SRUM Data with Autopsy</strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on our findings, we recall that the malicious executable had an open handle directed at the <code>Desktop</code> folder. Through <code>Autopsy</code> we notice a file named <code>users.db</code>. Given the circumstances, it&#39;s plausible that the attacker intended to siphon this data from the system.</p>

<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image42.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To validate our hypothesis, let&#39;s sift through <code>Data Artifacts</code> and access the <code>Run Programs</code> section. Our primary focus for network metadata analysis rests on <code>SRUDB.dat</code>.</p>

<p>If we look carefully enough, we will notice that <code>flag.txt</code> was deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing Rapid Triage Data - MFT/pagefile.sys (MFTECmd/Autopsy)</strong></p>
<p>We can leverage <code>MFT</code> in an attempt to recover <code>flag.txt</code>. Unfortunately, the affected machine&#39;s MFT table is not available.</p>
<p>For completeness&#39; sake, let&#39;s work on another system&#39;s MFT table (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\files\mft_data</code>) where <code>flag.txt</code> was also deleted.</p>
<p>Our initial step involves running <code>MFTEcmd</code> to parse the <code>$MFT</code> file, followed by searching for <code>flag.txt</code> within the report.</p>

<p>The output provides the location of <code>flag.txt</code> on the system (<code>\Users\johndoe\Desktop\reports</code>).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s now access the <code>MFT</code> file (<code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\files\mft_data</code>) using <code>MFT Explorer</code> (available at <code>C:\Users\johndoe\Desktop\Get-ZimmermanTools\net6\MFTExplorer</code>)</p>
<p>On the <code>Desktop</code>, within the <code>reports</code> folder, we discover <code>flag.txt</code> marked with the <code>Is deleted</code> attribute.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/image31.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When files are deleted from an NTFS file system volume, their <code>MFT</code> entries are marked as free and may be reused, but the data may remain on the disk until overwritten. That’s why recovery isn&#39;t always possible.</p>
<p>In the case of the compromised system the file was overwritten (that&#39;s why we used the <code>MFT</code> table of another system for the recovery exercise), but portions of its content were preserved in <code>pagefile.sys</code>.</p>
<p><code>pagefile.sys</code> is a designated system file in Windows that supplements your computer&#39;s RAM. When RAM nears its capacity, the system offloads less critical data, like certain files and applications, to the pagefile.</p>
<p>With knowledge of the file&#39;s partial content, we can scour the disk and retrieve our flag from <code>pagefile.sys</code> through <code>Autopsy</code>.</p>

<p>Given that the incident occurred between <code>09:13</code> and <code>09:30</code>, we can use <code>Autopsy</code> to map out the attacker&#39;s actions chronologically.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Autopsy employs <a href="https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso">Plaso</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s make the following selections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit event types to:<ul>
<li><code>Web Activity</code>: All</li>
<li><code>Other</code>: All</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Display Times in: GMT / UTC<ul>
<li><code>Start</code>: Aug 10, 2023 9:13:00 AM</li>
<li><code>End</code>: Aug 10, 2023 9:30:00 AM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/237/timeline.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This will allow us to generate a timeline detailing the actions undertaken by the malicious actor.</p>

<p>By applying specific filters, we can pinpoint the files accessed or established during this particular window.</p>

<h3 id="the-actual-attack-timeline">The Actual Attack Timeline</h3>
<p>Here are the <code>real</code> actions taken by the attacker (i.e. <code>not identified through digital forensics</code>). Based on what you&#39;ve learned up to this point, attempt to recognize and pinpoint any of these actions that remain undetected in this section.</p>
