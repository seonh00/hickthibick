<h3 id="domain-reconnaissance">Domain Reconnaissance</h3>
<p><code>Active Directory (AD) domain reconnaissance</code> represents a pivotal stage in the cyberattack lifecycle. During this phase, adversaries endeavor to gather information about the target environment, seeking to comprehend its architecture, network topology, security measures, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>While conducting AD domain reconnaissance, attackers focus on identifying crucial components such as Domain Controllers, user accounts, groups, trust relationships, organizational units (OUs), group policies, and other vital objects. By gaining insights into the AD environment, attackers can potentially pinpoint high-value targets, escalate their privileges, and move laterally within the network.</p>
<p><strong>User/Domain Reconnaissance Using Native Windows Executables</strong></p>
<p>An example of AD domain reconnaissance is when an adversary executes the <code>net group</code> command to obtain a list of <code>Domain Administrators</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image63.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Common native tools/commands utilized for domain reconnaissance include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>whoami /all</code></li>
<li><code>wmic computersystem get domain</code></li>
<li><code>net user /domain</code></li>
<li><code>net group &quot;Domain Admins&quot; /domain</code></li>
<li><code>arp -a</code></li>
<li><code>nltest /domain_trusts</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For detection, administrators can employ PowerShell to monitor for unusual scripts or cmdlets and process command-line monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>User/Domain Reconnaissance Using BloodHound/SharpHound</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound">BloodHound</a> is an open-source domain reconnaissance tool created to analyze and visualize the Active Directory (AD) environment. It is frequently employed by attackers to discern attack paths and potential security risks within an organization&#39;s AD infrastructure. BloodHound leverages graph theory and relationship mapping to elucidate trust relationships, permissions, and group memberships within the AD domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound">Sharphound</a> is a C# data collector for BloodHound. An example of usage includes an adversary running Sharphound with all collection methods (<code>-c all</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image56.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>BloodHound Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Under the hood, the BloodHound collector executes numerous LDAP queries directed at the Domain Controller, aiming to amass information about the domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, monitoring LDAP queries can be a challenge. By default, the Windows Event Log does not record them. The best option Windows can suggest is employing <code>Event 1644</code> - the LDAP performance monitoring log. Even with it enabled, BloodHound may not generate many of the expected events.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image81.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A more reliable approach is to utilize the Windows ETW provider <code>Microsoft-Windows-LDAP-Client</code>. As showcased previously in the <code>SOC Analyst</code> path, <a href="https://github.com/mandiant/SilkETW">SilkETW &amp; SilkService</a> are versatile C# wrappers for ETW, designed to simplify the intricacies of ETW, providing an accessible interface for research and introspection. <code>SilkService</code> supports output to the Windows Event Log, which streamlines log digestion. Another useful feature is the ability to employ <code>Yara</code> rules for hunting suspicious LDAP queries.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image57.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, Microsoft&#39;s ATP team has compiled a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/hunting-for-reconnaissance-activities-using-ldap-search-filters/ba-p/824726">list of LDAP filters frequently used by reconnaissance tools</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image59.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Armed with this list of LDAP filters, BloodHound activity can be detected more efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Search Breakdown</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Filtering by Index and Source</code>: The search begins by selecting events from the main index where the source is <code>XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</code>, which is the XML-formatted Windows Event Log for Sysmon (System Monitor) events. Sysmon is a service and device driver that logs system activity to the event log.</li>
<li><code>EventID Filter</code>: The search is further filtered to only select events with an <code>Event ID</code> of <code>1</code>. In Sysmon, Event ID 1 corresponds to <code>Process Creation</code> events, which log data about newly created processes.</li>
<li><code>Time Range Filter</code>: The search restricts the time range of events to those occurring between the Unix timestamps 1690447949 and 1690450687. These timestamps represent the earliest and latest times in which the events occurred.</li>
<li><code>Process Name Filter</code>: The search then filters events to only include those where the process_name field is one of a list of specific process names (e.g., <code>arp.exe</code>, <code>chcp.com</code>, <code>ipconfig.exe</code>, etc.) or where the <code>process_name</code> field is <code>cmd.exe</code> or <code>powershell.exe</code> and the process field contains certain substrings. This step is looking for events that involve certain system or network-related commands, as well as events where these commands were run from a Command Prompt or PowerShell session.</li>
<li><code>Statistics</code>: The stats command is used to aggregate events based on the fields <code>parent_process</code>, <code>parent_process_id</code>, <code>dest</code>, and <code>user</code>. For each unique combination of these fields, the search calculates the following statistics:<ul>
<li><code>values(process) as process</code>: This captures all unique values of the <code>process field</code> as a multivalue field named <code>process</code>.</li>
<li><code>min(_time) as _time</code>: This captures the earliest time (<code>_time</code>) that an event occurred within each group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Filtering by Process Count</code>: The where command is used to filter the results to only include those where the count of the process field is greater than <code>3</code>. This step is looking for instances where multiple processes (more than three) were executed by the same parent process.</li>

<p><strong>Search Breakdown</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Filtering by Index and Source</code>: The search starts by selecting events from the main index where the source is <code>WinEventLog:SilkService-Log</code>. This source represents Windows Event Log data gathered by <code>SilkETW</code>.</li>
<li><code>Time Range Filter</code>: The search restricts the time range of events to those occurring between the Unix timestamps 1690195896 and 1690285475. These timestamps represent the earliest and latest times in which the events occurred.</li>
<li><code>Path Extraction</code>: The <code>spath</code> command is used to extract fields from the <code>Message</code> field, which likely contains structured data such as <code>XML</code> or <code>JSON</code>. The <code>spath</code> command automatically identifies and extracts fields based on the data structure.</li>
<li><code>Field Renaming</code>: The <code>rename</code> command is used to rename fields that start with <code>XmlEventData.</code> to the equivalent field names without the <code>XmlEventData.</code> prefix. This is done for easier reference to the fields in later stages of the search.</li>
<li><code>Tabulating Results</code>: The <code>table</code> command is used to display the results in a tabular format with the following columns: <code>_time</code>, <code>ComputerName</code>, <code>ProcessName</code>, <code>ProcessId</code>, <code>DistinguishedName</code>, and <code>SearchFilter</code>. The <code>table</code> command only includes these fields in the output.</li>
<li><code>Sorting</code>: The <code>sort</code> command is used to sort the results based on the <code>_time</code> field in ascending order (from oldest to newest). The <code>0</code> argument means that there is no limit on the number of results to sort.</li>
<li><code>Search Filter</code>: The search command is used to filter the results to only include events where the <code>SearchFilter</code> field contains the string <code>*(samAccountType=805306368)*</code>. This step is looking for events related to LDAP queries with a specific filter condition.</li>
<li><code>Statistics</code>: The <code>stats</code> command is used to aggregate events based on the fields <code>ComputerName</code>, <code>ProcessName</code>, and <code>ProcessId</code>. For each unique combination of these fields, the search calculates the following statistics:<ul>
<li><code>min(_time) as _time</code>: The earliest time (<code>_time</code>) that an event occurred within each group.</li>
<li><code>max(_time) as maxTime</code>: The latest time (<code>_time</code>) that an event occurred within each group.</li>
<li><code>count</code>: The number of events within each group.</li>
<li><code>values(SearchFilter) as SearchFilter</code>: All unique values of the <code>SearchFilter</code> field within each group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Filtering by Event Count</code>: The <code>where</code> command is used to filter the results to only include those where the <code>count</code> field is greater than <code>10</code>. This step is looking for instances where the same process on the same computer made more than ten search queries with the specified filter condition.</li>
<li><code>Time Conversion</code>: The <code>convert</code> command is used to convert the <code>maxTime</code> field from Unix timestamp format to human-readable format (<code>ctime</code>).</li>

<h2 id="detecting-password-spraying">Detecting Password Spraying</h2>
<h3 id="password-spraying">Password Spraying</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries numerous passwords for a single user account, <code>password spraying</code> distributes the attack across multiple accounts using a limited set of commonly used or easily guessable passwords. The primary goal is to evade account lockout policies typically instituted by organizations. These policies usually lock an account after a specified number of unsuccessful login attempts to thwart brute-force attacks on individual accounts. However, password spraying lowers the chance of triggering account lockouts, as each user account receives only a few password attempts, making the attack less noticeable.</p>
<p>An example of password spraying using the <a href="https://github.com/Greenwolf/Spray">Spray</a> tool can be seen below.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image47.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Password Spraying Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Detecting password spraying through Windows logs involves the analysis and monitoring of specific event logs to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of such an attack. A common pattern is multiple failed logon attempts with <code>Event ID 4625 - Failed Logon</code> from different user accounts but originating from the same source IP address within a short time frame.</p>
<p>Other event logs that may aid in password spraying detection include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>4768 and ErrorCode 0x6 - Kerberos Invalid Users</code></li>
<li><code>4768 and ErrorCode 0x12 - Kerberos Disabled Users</code></li>
<li><code>4776 and ErrorCode 0xC000006A - NTLM Invalid Users</code></li>
<li><code>4776 and ErrorCode 0xC0000064 - NTLM Wrong Password</code></li>
<li><code>4648 - Authenticate Using Explicit Credentials</code></li>
<li><code>4771 - Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed</code></li>

<ul>
<li><code>Filtering by Index, Source, and EventCode</code>: The search starts by selecting events from the main index where the source is <code>WinEventLog:Security</code> and the <code>EventCode</code> is <code>4625</code>. This EventCode represents failed logon attempts in the Windows Security Event Log.</li>
<li><code>Time Range Filter</code>: The search restricts the time range of events to those occurring between the Unix timestamps 1690280680 and 1690289489. These timestamps represent the earliest and latest times in which the events occurred.</li>
<li><code>Time Binning</code>: The <code>bin</code> command is used to create <code>time buckets of 15 minutes</code> duration for each event based on the <code>_time</code> field.

<h2 id="detecting-responder-like-attacks">Detecting Responder-like Attacks</h2>
<h3 id="llmnr-nbt-ns-mdns-poisoning">LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS Poisoning</h3>
<p><code>LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) poisoning</code>, also referred to as NBNS spoofing, are network-level attacks that exploit inefficiencies in these name resolution protocols. Both <code>LLMNR</code> and <code>NBT-NS</code> are used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses on local networks when the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) resolution fails. However, their lack of built-in security mechanisms renders them susceptible to spoofing and poisoning attacks.</p>
<p>Typically, attackers employ the <a href="https://github.com/lgandx/Responder">Responder</a> tool to execute LLMNR, NBT-NS, or mDNS poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A victim device sends a name resolution query for a mistyped hostname (e.g., <code>fileshrae</code>).</li>
<li>DNS fails to resolve the mistyped hostname.</li>
<li>The victim device sends a name resolution query for the mistyped hostname using LLMNR/NBT-NS.</li>
<li>The attacker&#39;s host responds to the LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic, pretending to know the identity of the requested host. This effectively poisons the service, directing the victim to communicate with the adversary-controlled system.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image68.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The result of a successful attack is the acquisition of the victim&#39;s NetNTLM hash, which can be either cracked or relayed in an attempt to gain access to systems where these credentials are valid.</p>
<p><strong>Responder Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Detecting LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS poisoning can be challenging. However, organizations can mitigate the risk by implementing the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy network monitoring solutions to detect unusual LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic patterns, such as an elevated volume of name resolution requests from a single source.</li>
<li>Employ a honeypot approach - name resolution for non-existent hosts should fail. If an attacker is present and spoofing LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS responses, name resolution will succeed. <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/">https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/</a></li>

<h2 id="detecting-kerberoasting-as-reproasting">Detecting Kerberoasting/AS-REProasting</h2>
<h3 id="kerberoasting">Kerberoasting</h3>
<p><code>Kerberoasting</code> is a technique targeting service accounts in Active Directory environments to extract and crack their password hashes. The attack exploits the way Kerberos service tickets are encrypted and the use of weak or easily crackable passwords for service accounts. Once an attacker successfully cracks the password hashes, they can gain unauthorized access to the targeted service accounts and potentially move laterally within the network.</p>
<p>An example of a Kerberoasting attack is using the <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus">Rubeus</a> <code>kerberoast</code> module.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image76.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Identify Target Service Accounts</code>: The attacker enumerates Active Directory to identify service accounts with <code>Service Principal Names (SPNs)</code> set. Service accounts are often associated with services running on the network, such as SQL Server, Exchange, or other applications. The following is a code snippet from <code>Rubeus</code> that is related to this step. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image2.png" alt=""></li>
<li><code>Request TGS Tickets</code>: The attacker uses the identified service accounts to request <code>Ticket Granting Service (TGS)</code> tickets from the <code>Key Distribution Center (KDC)</code>. These TGS tickets contain encrypted service account password hashes. The following is a code snippet from <code>Rubeus</code> that is related to this step. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image87.png" alt=""></li>
<li><code>Offline Brute-Force Attack</code>: The attacker employs offline brute-force techniques, utilizing password cracking tools like <code>Hashcat</code> or <code>John the Ripper</code>, to attempt to crack the encrypted password hashes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benign Service Access Process &amp; Related Events</strong></p>
<p>When a user connects to an <code>MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)</code> database using a service account with an <code>SPN</code>, the following steps occur in the Kerberos authentication process:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TGT Request</code>: The user (client) initiates the authentication process by requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC), typically part of the Active Directory domain controller.</li>
<li><code>TGT Issue</code>: The KDC verifies the user&#39;s identity (usually through a password hash) and issues a TGT encrypted with the user&#39;s secret key. The TGT is valid for a specific period and allows the user to request service tickets without needing to re-authenticate.</li>
<li><code>Service Ticket Request</code>: The client sends a service ticket request (TGS-REQ) to the KDC for the MSSQL server&#39;s SPN using the TGT obtained in the previous step.</li>
<li><code>Service Ticket Issue</code>: The KDC validates the client&#39;s TGT and, if successful, issues a service ticket (TGS) encrypted with the service account&#39;s secret key, containing the client&#39;s identity and a session key. The client then receives the TGS.</li>
<li><code>Client Connection</code>: The client connects to the MSSQL server and sends the TGS to the server as part of the authentication process.</li>
<li><code>MSSQL Server Validates the TGS</code>: The MSSQL server decrypts the TGS using its own secret key to obtain the session key and client identity. If the TGS is valid and the session key is correct, the MSSQL server accepts the client&#39;s connection and grants access to the requested resources. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image25.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the steps mentioned above can also be observed during network traffic analysis:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>During the Kerberos authentication process, several security-related events are generated in the Windows Event Log when a user connects to an MSSQL server:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Event ID 4768 (Kerberos TGT Request)</code>: Occurs when the client workstation requests a TGT from the KDC, generating this event in the Security log on the domain controller.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request)</code>: Generated after the client receives the TGT and requests a TGS for the MSSQL server&#39;s SPN.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4624 (Logon)</code>: Logged in the Security log on the MSSQL server, indicating a successful logon once the client initiates a connection to the MSSQL server and logs in using the service account with the SPN to establish the connection. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image66.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kerberoasting Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Since the initial phase of Kerberoasting involves identifying target service accounts, monitoring LDAP activity, as explained in the domain reconnaissance section, can help in identifying suspicious LDAP queries.</p>
<p>An alternative approach focuses on the difference between benign service access and a Kerberoasting attack. In both scenarios, TGS tickets for the service will be requested, but only in the case of benign service access will the user connect to the server and present the TGS ticket.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Detection logic entails finding all events for TGS requests and logon events from the same user, then identifying instances where a TGS request is present without a subsequent logon event. In the case of IIS service access using a service account with an SPN, an additional <code>4648 (A logon was attempted using explicit credentials)</code> event will be generated as a logon event.</p>

<p><strong>Search Breakdown</strong>:</p>
<p>This Splunk search query is different from the previous query primarily due to the use of the <code>transaction</code> command, which groups events into transactions based on specified fields and criteria.</p>

<li><code>| transaction username keepevicted=true maxspan=5s endswith=(EventCode=4648) startswith=(EventCode=4769)</code>: Groups events into <code>transactions</code> based on the <code>username</code> field. The <code>keepevicted=true</code> option includes events that do not meet the transaction criteria. The <code>maxspan=5s</code> option sets the maximum time duration of a transaction to 5 seconds. The <code>endswith=(EventCode=4648)</code> and <code>startswith=(EventCode=4769)</code> options specify that transactions should start with an event with <code>EventCode 4769</code> and end with an event with <code>EventCode 4648</code>.</li>
<li><code>| where closed_txn=0 AND EventCode = 4769</code>: Filters the results to only include transactions that are not closed (<code>closed_txn=0</code>) and have an <code>EventCode</code> of <code>4769</code>.</li>
<li><code>| table _time, EventCode, service_name, username</code>: Displays the remaining events in tabular format with the specified fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>This query focuses on identifying events with an <code>EventCode</code> of <code>4769</code> that are part of an incomplete transaction (i.e., they did not end with an event with <code>EventCode 4648</code> within the <code>5</code>-second window).</p>
<h3 id="as-reproasting">AS-REPRoasting</h3>
<p><code>ASREPRoasting</code> is a technique used in Active Directory environments to target user accounts without pre-authentication enabled. In Kerberos, pre-authentication is a security feature requiring users to prove their identity before the TGT is issued. However, certain user accounts, such as those with unconstrained delegation, do not have pre-authentication enabled, making them susceptible to ASREPRoasting attacks.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image40.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Identify Target User Accounts</code>: The attacker identifies user accounts without pre-authentication enabled. The following is a code snippet from <code>Rubeus</code> that is related to this step. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image13.png" alt=""></li>
<li><code>Request AS-REQ Service Tickets</code>: The attacker initiates an AS-REQ service ticket request for each identified target user account. The following is a code snippet from <code>Rubeus</code> that is related to this step. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image24.png" alt=""></li>
<li><code>Offline Brute-Force Attack</code>: The attacker captures the encrypted TGTs and employs offline brute-force techniques to attempt to crack the password hashes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kerberos Pre-Authentication</strong></p>
<p><code>Kerberos pre-authentication</code> is an additional security mechanism in the Kerberos authentication protocol enhancing user credentials protection during the authentication process. When a user tries to access a network resource or service, the client sends an authentication request AS-REQ to the KDC.</p>
<p>If pre-authentication is enabled, this request also contains an encrypted timestamp (<code>pA-ENC-TIMESTAMP</code>). The KDC attempts to decrypt this timestamp using the user password hash and, if successful, issues a TGT to the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image79.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When pre-authentication is disabled, there is no timestamp validation by the KDC, allowing users to request a TGT ticket without knowing the user password.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image78.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>AS-REPRoasting Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Kerberoasting, the initial phase of AS-REPRoasting involves identifying user accounts with unconstrained delegation enabled or accounts without pre-authentication, which can be detected by LDAP monitoring.</p>
<p>Kerberos authentication <code>Event ID 4768 (TGT Request)</code> contains a <code>PreAuthType</code> attribute in the additional information part of the event indicating whether pre-authentication is enabled for an account.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-pass-the-hash">Detecting Pass-the-Hash</h2>
<h3 id="pass-the-hash">Pass-the-Hash</h3>
<p><code>Pass-the-Hash</code> is a technique utilized by attackers to authenticate to a networked system using the <code>NTLM</code> hash of a user&#39;s password instead of the plaintext password. The attack capitalizes on the way Windows stores password hashes in memory, enabling adversaries with administrative access to capture the hash and reuse it for lateral movement within the network.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker employs tools such as <code>Mimikatz</code> to extract the <code>NTLM</code> hash of a user currently logged onto the compromised system. Note that local administrator privileges are required on the system to extract the user&#39;s hash. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image65.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Armed with the <code>NTLM</code> hash, the attacker can authenticate as the targeted user on other systems or network resources without needing to know the actual password. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image52.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Utilizing the authenticated session, the attacker can move laterally within the network, gaining unauthorized access to other systems and resources. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image62.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows Access Tokens &amp; Alternate Credentials</strong></p>
<p>An <code>access token</code> is a data structure that defines the security context of a process or thread. It contains information about the associated user account&#39;s identity and privileges. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user&#39;s password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system generates an access token. Subsequently, any process executed on behalf of that user possesses a copy of this access token. (<strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens</a>)</p>
<p><code>Alternate Credentials</code> provide a way to supply different login credentials (username and password) for specific actions or processes without altering the user&#39;s primary login session. This permits a user or process to execute certain commands or access resources as a different user without logging out or switching user accounts. The <code>runas</code> command is a Windows command-line tool that allows users to execute commands as another user. When the <code>runas</code> command is executed, a new access token is generated, which can be verified with the <code>whoami</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <code>runas</code> command also contains an interesting flag <code>/netonly</code>. This flag indicates that the specified user information is for remote access only. Even though the <code>whoami</code> command returns the original username, the spawned <code>cmd.exe</code> can still access the Domain Controller root folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each <code>access token</code> references a <code>LogonSession</code> generated at user logon. This <code>LogonSession</code> security structure contains such information as Username, Domain, and AuthenticationID (<code>NTHash/LMHash</code>), and is used when the process attempts to access remote resources. When the <code>netonly</code> flag is used, the process has the same <code>access token</code> but a different <code>LogonSession</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image34.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Pass-the-Hash Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>From the Windows Event Log perspective, the following logs are generated when the <code>runas</code> command is executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>runas</code> command is executed without the <code>/netonly</code> flag - <code>Event ID 4624 (Logon)</code> with <code>LogonType 2 (interactive)</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image38.png" alt=""></li>
<li>When <code>runas</code> command is executed with the <code>/netonly</code> flag - <code>Event ID 4624 (Logon)</code> with <code>LogonType 9 (NewCredentials)</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image32.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>Simple detection would involve looking for <code>Event ID 4624</code> and <code>LogonType 9</code>, but as mentioned before, there could be some false positives related to <code>runas</code> usage.</p>
<p>The main difference between <code>runas</code> with the <code>netonly</code> flag and the <code>Pass-the-Hash</code> attack is that in the latter case, <code>Mimikatz</code> will access the <code>LSASS</code> process memory to change <code>LogonSession</code> credential materials. Thus, initial detection can be enhanced by correlating <code>User Logon with NewCredentials</code> events with <code>Sysmon Process Access Event Code 10</code>.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-pass-the-ticket">Detecting Pass-the-Ticket</h2>
<h3 id="pass-the-ticket">Pass-the-Ticket</h3>
<p><code>Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)</code> is a lateral movement technique used by attackers to move laterally within a network by abusing Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) and TGS (Ticket Granting Service) tickets. Instead of using NTLM hashes, PtT leverages Kerberos tickets to authenticate to other systems and access network resources without needing to know the users&#39; passwords. This technique allows attackers to move laterally and gain unauthorized access across multiple systems.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker gains administrative access to a system, either through an initial compromise or privilege escalation.</li>
<li>The attacker uses tools such as <code>Mimikatz</code> or <code>Rubeus</code> to extract valid TGT or TGS tickets from the compromised system&#39;s memory. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image9.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker submits the extracted ticket for the current logon session. The attacker can now authenticate to other systems and network resources without needing plaintext passwords. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image41.png" alt=""> <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image10.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kerberos Authentication Process</strong></p>
<p><code>Kerberos</code> is a network authentication protocol used to securely authenticate users and services within a Windows Active Directory (AD) environment. The following steps occur in the Kerberos authentication process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user (client) initiates the authentication process by requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC), typically part of the Active Directory domain controller.</li>
<li>The KDC verifies the user&#39;s identity (usually through a password) and issues a TGT encrypted with the user&#39;s secret key. The TGT is valid for a specific period and allows the user to request service tickets without needing to re-authenticate.</li>
<li>The client sends a service ticket request (TGS-REQ) to the KDC for the service using the TGT obtained in the previous step.</li>
<li>The KDC validates the client&#39;s TGT and, if successful, issues a service ticket (TGS) encrypted with the service account&#39;s secret key and containing the client&#39;s identity and a session key. The client then receives the service ticket (TGS) from the KDC.</li>
<li>The client connects to the server and sends the TGS to the server as part of the authentication process.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image25.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Related Windows Security Events</strong></p>
<p>During user access to network resources, several Windows Event Logs are generated to record the logon process and related activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Event ID 4648 (Explicit Credential Logon Attempt)</code>: This event is logged when explicit credentials (e.g., username and password) are provided during logon.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4624 (Logon)</code>: This event indicates that a user has successfully logged on to the system.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4672 (Special Logon)</code>: This event is logged when a user&#39;s logon includes special privileges, such as running applications as an administrator.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4768 (Kerberos TGT Request)</code>: This event is logged when a client requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) during the Kerberos authentication process.</li>
<li><code>Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request)</code>: When a client requests a Service Ticket (TGS Ticket) to access a remote service during the Kerberos authentication process, Event ID 4769 is generated.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image14.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Pass-the-Ticket Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Detecting Pass-the-Ticket attacks can be challenging, as attackers are leveraging valid Kerberos tickets instead of traditional credential hashes. The key distinction is that when the Pass-the-Ticket attack is executed, the Kerberos Authentication process will be partial. For example, an attacker imports a TGT ticket into a logon session and requests a TGS ticket for a remote service. From the Domain Controller perspective, the imported TGT was never requested before from the attacker’s system, so there won&#39;t be an associated Event ID 4768.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This approach can be converted into the following Splunk detection: Look for <code>Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request)</code> <code>or</code> <code>Event ID 4770 (Kerberos Service Ticket was renewed)</code> without a prior <code>Event ID 4768 (Kerberos TGT Request)</code> from the same system within a specific time window.</p>
<p>Another approach is looking for mismatches between Service and Host IDs (in <code>Event ID 4769</code>) and the actual Source and Destination IPs (in <code>Event ID 3</code>). Note that there will be several legitimate mismatches, but unusual hostnames or services should be investigated further.</p>
<p>Also, in cases where an attacker imports a TGS ticket into the logon session, it is important to review <code>Event ID 4771 (Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed)</code> for mismatches between Pre-Authentication type and Failure Code. For example, <code>Pre-Authentication type 2 (Encrypted Timestamp)</code> with <code>Failure Code 0x18 (Pre-authentication information was invalid)</code> would indicate that the client sent a Kerberos AS-REQ with a pre-authentication encrypted timestamp, but the KDC couldn’t decrypt it.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that these detection opportunities should be enhanced with behavior-based detection. In other words, context is vital. Looking for Event IDs <code>4769</code>, <code>4770</code>, or <code>4771</code> alone will likely generate many false positives. Correlate the event logs with user and system behavior patterns, and consider whether there are any suspicious activities associated with the user or system involved in the logs.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-overpass-the-hash">Detecting Overpass-the-Hash</h2>
<h3 id="overpass-the-hash">Overpass-the-Hash</h3>
<p>Adversaries may utilize the <code>Overpass-the-Hash</code> technique to obtain Kerberos TGTs by leveraging stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment or to bypass typical system access controls. Overpass-the-Hash (also known as <code>Pass-the-Key</code>) allows authentication to occur via Kerberos rather than NTLM. Both NTLM hashes or AES keys can serve as a basis for requesting a Kerberos TGT.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker employs tools such as Mimikatz to extract the NTLM hash of a user who is currently logged in to the compromised system. The attacker must have at least local administrator privileges on the system to be able to extract the hash of the user. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image65.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker uses a tool such as Rubeus to craft a raw AS-REQ request for a specified user to request a TGT ticket. This step does not require elevated privileges on the host to request the TGT, which makes it a stealthier approach than the Mimikatz Pass-the-Hash attack. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image3.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Analogous to the Pass-the-Ticket technique, the attacker submits the requested ticket for the current logon session.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overpass-the-Hash Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p><code>Mimikatz</code>&#39;s Overpass-the-Hash attack leaves the same artifacts as the Pass-the-Hash attack, and can be detected using the same strategies.</p>
<p><code>Rubeus</code>, however, presents a somewhat different scenario. Unless the requested TGT is used on another host, Pass-the-Ticket detection mechanisms may not be effective, as Rubeus sends an AS-REQ request directly to the Domain Controller (DC), generating <code>Event ID 4768 (Kerberos TGT Request)</code>. However, communication with the DC (<code>TCP/UDP port 88</code>) from an unusual process can serve as an indicator of a potential Overpass-the-Hash attack.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-golden-tickets-silver-tickets">Detecting Golden Tickets/Silver Tickets</h2>
<h3 id="golden-ticket">Golden Ticket</h3>
<p>A <code>Golden Ticket</code> attack is a potent method where an attacker forges a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to gain unauthorized access to a Windows Active Directory domain as a domain administrator. The attacker creates a TGT with arbitrary user credentials and then uses this forged ticket to impersonate a domain administrator, thereby gaining full control over the domain. The Golden Ticket attack is stealthy and persistent, as the forged ticket has a long validity period and remains valid until it expires or is revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker extracts the NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account using a <code>DCSync</code> attack (alternatively, they can use <code>NTDS.dit</code> and <code>LSASS process dumps</code> on the Domain Controller). <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image74.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Armed with the <code>KRBTGT</code> hash, the attacker forges a TGT for an arbitrary user account, assigning it domain administrator privileges. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image17.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker injects the forged TGT in the same manner as a Pass-the-Ticket attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Golden Ticket Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Detecting Golden Ticket attacks can be challenging, as the TGT can be forged offline by an attacker, leaving virtually no traces of <code>Mimikatz</code> execution. One option is to monitor common methods of extracting the <code>KRBTGT</code> hash:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DCSync attack</code></li>
<li><code>NTDS.dit file access</code></li>
<li><code>LSASS memory read on the domain controller (Sysmon Event ID 10)</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="silver-ticket">Silver Ticket</h3>
<p>Adversaries who possess the password hash of a target service account (e.g., <code>SharePoint</code>, <code>MSSQL</code>) may forge Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets, also known as <code>Silver Tickets</code>. Silver tickets can be used to impersonate any user, but they are more limited in scope than Golden Tickets, as they only allow adversaries to access a specific resource (e.g., <code>MSSQL</code>) and the system hosting the resource.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker extracts the NTLM hash of the targeted service account (or the computer account for <code>CIFS</code> access) using tools like <code>Mimikatz</code> or other credential dumping techniques.</li>
<li>Generate a Silver Ticket: Using the extracted NTLM hash, the attacker employs tools like <code>Mimikatz</code> to create a forged TGS ticket for the specified service. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image37.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker injects the forged TGT in the same manner as a Pass-the-Ticket attack. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image77.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Silver Ticket Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Detecting forged service tickets (TGS) can be challenging, as there are no simple indicators of attack. In both Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket attacks, arbitrary users can be used, <code>including non-existent ones</code>. <code>Event ID 4720 (A user account was created)</code> can help identify newly created users. Subsequently, we can compare this user list with logged-in users.</p>
<p>Because there is no validation for user permissions, users can be granted administrative permissions. <code>Event ID 4672 (Special Logon)</code> can be employed to detect anomalously assigned privileges.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-silver-tickets-with-splunk">Detecting Silver Tickets With Splunk</h3>
<p>Now let&#39;s explore how we can identify Silver Tickets, using Splunk.</p>
<p><strong>Detecting Silver Tickets With Splunk Through User Correlation</strong></p>

<h2 id="detecting-unconstrained-delegation-constrained-delegation-attacks">Detecting Unconstrained Delegation/Constrained Delegation Attacks</h2>
<h3 id="unconstrained-delegation">Unconstrained Delegation</h3>
<p><code>Unconstrained Delegation</code> is a privilege that can be granted to User Accounts or Computer Accounts in an Active Directory environment, allowing a service to authenticate to another resource on behalf of <code>any</code> user. This might be necessary when, for example, a web server requires access to a database server to make changes on a user&#39;s behalf.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image49.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker identifies systems on which Unconstrained Delegation is enabled for service accounts. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image19.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker gains access to a system with Unconstrained Delegation enabled.</li>
<li>The attacker extracts Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) tickets from the memory of the compromised system using tools such as <code>Mimikatz</code>. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image3.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kerberos Authentication With Unconstrained Delegation</strong></p>
<p>When Unconstrained Delegation is enabled, the main difference in Kerberos Authentication is that when a user requests a TGS ticket for a remote service, the Domain Controller will embed the user&#39;s TGT into the service ticket. When connecting to the remote service, the user will present not only the TGS ticket but also their own TGT. When the service needs to authenticate to another service on behalf of the user, it will present the user&#39;s TGT ticket, which the service received with the TGS ticket.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image51.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Unconstrained Delegation Attack Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>PowerShell commands and LDAP search filters used for Unconstrained Delegation discovery can be detected by monitoring PowerShell script block logging (<code>Event ID 4104</code>) and LDAP request logging.</p>
<p>The main goal of an Unconstrained Delegation attack is to retrieve and reuse TGT tickets, so Pass-the-Ticket detection can be used as well.</p>

<h3 id="constrained-delegation">Constrained Delegation</h3>
<p><code>Constrained Delegation</code> is a feature in Active Directory that allows services to delegate user credentials only to specified resources, reducing the risk associated with Unconstrained Delegation. Any user or computer accounts that have service principal names (SPNs) set in their <code>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</code> property can impersonate any user in the domain to those specific SPNs.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image26.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker identifies systems where Constrained Delegation is enabled and determines the resources to which they are allowed to delegate. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image35.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker gains access to the TGT of the principal (user or computer). The TGT can be extracted from memory (Rubeus dump) or requested with the principal&#39;s hash. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image64.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker uses the S4U technique to impersonate a high-privileged account to the targeted service (requesting a TGS ticket). <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image48.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker injects the requested ticket and accesses targeted services as the impersonated user. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image60.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kerberos Protocol Extensions - Service For User</strong></p>
<p><code>Service for User to Self (S4U2self)</code> and <code>Service for User to Proxy (S4U2proxy)</code> allow a service to request a ticket from the Key Distribution Center (KDC) on behalf of a user. S4U2self allows a service to obtain a TGS for itself on behalf of a user, while S4U2proxy allows the service to obtain a TGS on behalf of a user for a second service.</p>
<p>S4U2self was designed to enable a user to request a TGS ticket when another method of authentication was used instead of Kerberos. Importantly, this TGS ticket can be requested on behalf of any user, for example, an Administrator.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image29.png" alt=""></p>
<p>S4U2proxy was designed to take a forwardable ticket and use it to request a TGS ticket to any SPN specified in the <code>msds-allowedtodelegateto</code> options for the user specified in the S4U2self part.</p>
<p>With a combination of S4U2self and S4U2proxy, an attacker can impersonate any user to service principal names (SPNs) set in <code>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</code> properties.</p>
<p><strong>Constrained Delegation Attack Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Unconstrained Delegation, it is possible to detect PowerShell commands and LDAP requests aimed at discovering vulnerable Constrained Delegation users and computers.</p>
<p>To request a TGT ticket for a principal, as well as a TGS ticket using the S4U technique, Rubeus makes connections to the Domain Controller. This activity can be detected as an unusual process network connection to TCP/UDP port <code>88</code> (Kerberos).</p>

<h2 id="detecting-dcsync-dcshadow">Detecting DCSync/DCShadow</h2>
<h3 id="dcsync">DCSync</h3>
<p><code>DCSync</code> is a technique exploited by attackers to extract password hashes from Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs). This method capitalizes on the <code>Replication Directory Changes</code> permission typically granted to domain controllers, enabling them to read all object attributes, including password hashes. Members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups, or computer accounts on the domain controller, have the capability to execute DCSync to extract password data from Active Directory. This data may encompass both current and historical hashes of potentially valuable accounts, such as KRBTGT and Administrators.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker secures administrative access to a domain-joined system or escalates privileges to acquire the requisite rights to request replication data.</li>
<li>Utilizing tools such as Mimikatz, the attacker requests domain replication data by using the DRSGetNCChanges interface, effectively mimicking a legitimate domain controller. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image73.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The attacker may then craft Golden Tickets, Silver Tickets, or opt to employ Pass-the-Hash/Overpass-the-Hash attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DCSync Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p><code>DS-Replication-Get-Changes</code> operations can be recorded with <code>Event ID 4662</code>. However, an additional <code>Audit Policy Configuration</code> is needed since it is not enabled by default (Computer Configuration/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Advanced Audit Policy Configuration/DS Access).</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image72.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Seek out events containing the property <code>{1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2}</code>, corresponding to <code>DS-Replication-Get-Changes</code>, as Event <code>4662</code> solely consists of GUIDs.</p>

<h3 id="dcshadow">DCShadow</h3>
<p><code>DCShadow</code> is an advanced tactic employed by attackers to enact unauthorized alterations to Active Directory objects, encompassing the creation or modification of objects without producing standard security logs. The assault harnesses the <code>Directory Replicator (Replicating Directory Changes)</code> permission, customarily granted to domain controllers for replication tasks. DCShadow is a clandestine technique enabling attackers to manipulate Active Directory data and establish persistence within the network. Registration of a rogue DC necessitates the creation of new server and <code>nTDSDSA</code> objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which demands Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the <code>KRBTGT</code> hash.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker secures administrative access to a domain-joined system or escalates privileges to acquire the necessary rights to request replication data.</li>
<li>The attacker registers a rogue domain controller within the domain, leveraging the <code>Directory Replicator</code> permission, and executes changes to AD objects, such as modifying user groups to Domain Administrator groups. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image43.png" alt=""></li>
<li>The rogue domain controller initiates replication with the legitimate domain controllers, disseminating the changes throughout the domain. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/image42.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DCShadow Detection Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>To emulate a Domain Controller, DCShadow must implement specific modifications in Active Directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Add a new nTDSDSA object</code></li>
<li><code>Append a global catalog ServicePrincipalName to the computer object</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>Event ID 4742 (Computer account was changed)</code> logs changes related to computer objects, including <code>ServicePrincipalName</code>.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-beaconing-malware">Detecting Beaconing Malware</h2>
<p><code>Malware beaconing</code> is a technique we frequently encounter in our cybersecurity investigations. It refers to the periodic communication initiated by malware-infected systems with their respective command and control (C2) servers. The beacons, typically small data packets, are sent at regular intervals, much like a lighthouse sends out a regular signal.</p>
<p>In our analysis of beaconing behavior, we often observe several distinct patterns. The beaconing intervals can be fixed, jittered (varied slightly from a fixed pattern), or follow a more complex schedule based on the malware&#39;s specific objectives. We&#39;ve encountered malware that uses various protocols for beaconing, including HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, and even ICMP (ping).</p>
<p>In this section, we will concentrate on detecting the beaconing behavior associated with a widely recognized Command and Control (C2) framework known as <code>Cobalt Strike</code> (in its default configuration).</p>

<h2 id="detecting-nmap-port-scanning">Detecting Nmap Port Scanning</h2>
<p><code>Port scanning with Nmap</code> is a key technique in the toolkit of attackers and penetration testers alike. In essence, what we&#39;re doing with Nmap is probing networked systems for open ports - these are the &#39;gates&#39; through which data passes in and out of a system. Open ports can be likened to doors that might be unlocked in a building - doors that attackers could potentially use to gain access.</p>
<p>When we use Nmap for port scanning, we&#39;re basically initiating a series of connection requests. We systematically attempt to establish a TCP handshake with each port in the target&#39;s address space. If the connection is successful, it indicates that the port is open. This is where it gets interesting. When we connect to an open port, the service listening on that port might send back a &quot;banner&quot; - this is essentially a little bit of data that tells us what service is running, and maybe even what version it&#39;s running.</p>
<p>But let&#39;s clear up a misconception - when we&#39;re talking about Nmap sending data to the scanning port, we&#39;re not actually sending any real data. Aside from the actual TCP handshake itself, the payload of the packets Nmap sends is zero. We&#39;re not sending any extra data; we&#39;re just trying to initiate a connection.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-kerberos-brute-force-attacks">Detecting Kerberos Brute Force Attacks</h2>
<p>When adversaries perform <code>Kerberos-based user enumeration</code>, they send an AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) message to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is responsible for handling Kerberos authentication. This message includes the username they&#39;re trying to validate. They pay close attention to the response they receive, as it reveals valuable information about the existence of the specified user account.</p>
<p>A valid username will prompt the server to <code>return a TGT</code> or raise an error like <code>KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED</code>, indicating that preauthentication is required. On the other hand, an invalid username will be met with a Kerberos error code <code>KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN</code> in the AS-REP (Authentication Service Response) message. By examining the responses to their AS-REQ messages, adversaries can quickly determine which usernames are valid on the target system.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-kerberoasting">Detecting Kerberoasting</h2>
<p>In 2016, a number of blog posts and articles emerged discussing the tactic of querying Service Principal Name (SPN) accounts and their corresponding tickets, an attack that came to be known as <code>Kerberoasting</code>. By possessing just one legitimate user account and its password, an attacker could retrieve the SPN tickets and attempt to break them offline.</p>
<p>After examining numerous resources on kerberoasting, it is evident that <code>RC4</code> is utilized for ticket encryption behind the scenes. We will exploit this underpinning as a detection point in this section.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-golden-tickets">Detecting Golden Tickets</h2>
<p>Previously in this section, we covered <code>Golden Tickets</code>. Unfortunately, Zeek lacks the ability to trustworthily identify Golden Tickets. Therefore, we will concentrate our Splunk search on uncovering anomalies in Kerberos ticket creation.</p>
<p>In a Golden Ticket or Pass-the-Ticket attack, the attacker bypasses the usual Kerberos authentication process, which involves the AS-REQ and AS-REP messages.</p>
<p>In a typical Kerberos authentication process, a client begins by sending an AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) message to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), specifically the Authentication Service (AS), requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). The KDC responds with an AS-REP (Authentication Service Response) message, which includes the TGT if the client&#39;s credentials are valid. The client can then use the TGT to request service tickets (Ticket Granting Service tickets, or TGS) for specific services on the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Golden Ticket attack, the attacker generates a forged TGT, which grants them access to any service on the network without having to authenticate with the KDC. Since the attacker has a forged TGT, they can directly request TGS tickets without going through the AS-REQ and AS-REP process.</li>
<li>In a Pass-the-Ticket attack, the attacker steals a valid TGT or TGS ticket from a legitimate user (for example, by compromising their machine) and then uses that ticket to access services on the network as if they were the legitimate user. Again, since the attacker already has a valid ticket, they can bypass the AS-REQ and AS-REP process.</li>

<h2 id="detecting-cobalt-strike-s-psexec">Detecting Cobalt Strike&#39;s PSExec</h2>
<p>Cobalt Strike&#39;s <code>psexec</code> command is an implementation of the popular PsExec tool, which is a part of Microsoft&#39;s Sysinternals Suite. It&#39;s a lightweight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems. Cobalt Strike&#39;s version is utilized to execute payloads on remote systems, as part of the post-exploitation process.</p>
<p>When the <code>psexec</code> command is invoked within Cobalt Strike, the following steps occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Service Creation</code>: The tool first creates a new service on the target system. This service is responsible for executing the desired payload. The service is typically created with a random name to avoid easy detection.</li>
<li><code>File Transfer</code>: Cobalt Strike then transfers the payload to the target system, often to the <code>ADMIN$</code> share. This is typically done using the SMB protocol.</li>
<li><code>Service Execution</code>: The newly created service is then started, which in turn executes the payload. This payload can be a shellcode, an executable, or any other file type that can be executed.</li>
<li><code>Service Removal</code>: After the payload has been executed, the service is stopped and deleted from the target system to minimize traces of the intrusion.</li>
<li><code>Communication</code>: If the payload is a beacon or another type of backdoor, it will typically establish communication back to the Cobalt Strike team server, allowing for further commands to be sent and executed on the compromised system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cobalt Strike&#39;s <code>psexec</code> works over port 445 (SMB), and it requires local administrator privileges on the target system. Therefore, it&#39;s often used after initial access has been achieved and privileges have been escalated.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-zerologon">Detecting Zerologon</h2>
<p>The <code>Zerologon</code> vulnerability, also known as CVE-2020-1472, is a critical flaw in the implementation of the Netlogon Remote Protocol, specifically in the cryptographic algorithm used by the protocol. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. Let&#39;s dive into the technical details of this flaw.</p>
<p>At the heart of Zerologon is the cryptographic issue in the way Microsoft&#39;s Netlogon Remote Protocol authenticates users and machines in a Windows domain. When a client wants to authenticate against the domain controller, it uses a protocol called MS-NRPC, a part of Netlogon, to establish a secure channel.</p>
<p>During this process, the client and the server generate a session key, which is computed from the machine account&#39;s password. This key is then used to derive an initialization vector (IV) for the AES-CFB8 encryption mode. In a secure configuration, the IV should be unique and random for each encryption operation. However, due to the flawed implementation in the Netlogon protocol, the IV is set to a fixed value of all zeros.</p>
<p>The attacker can exploit this cryptographic weakness by attempting to authenticate against the domain controller using a session key consisting of all zeros, effectively bypassing the authentication process. This allows the attacker to establish a secure channel with the domain controller without knowing the machine account&#39;s password.</p>
<p>Once this channel is established, the attacker can utilize the NetrServerPasswordSet2 function to change the computer account&#39;s password to any value, including a blank password. This effectively gives the attacker full control over the domain controller and, by extension, the entire Active Directory domain.</p>
<p>The Zerologon vulnerability is particularly dangerous due to its simplicity and the level of access it provides to attackers. Exploiting this flaw requires only a few Netlogon messages, and it can be executed within seconds.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-exfiltration-http-">Detecting Exfiltration (HTTP)</h2>
<p><code>Data exfiltration</code> inside the POST body is a technique that attackers employ to extract sensitive information from a compromised system by disguising it as legitimate web traffic. It involves transmitting the stolen data from the compromised system to an external server controlled by the attacker using HTTP POST requests. Since POST requests are commonly used for legitimate purposes, such as form submissions and file uploads, this method of data exfiltration can be difficult to detect.</p>
<p>To exfiltrate the data, the attackers send it as the body of an HTTP POST request to their command and control (C2) server. They often use seemingly innocuous URLs and headers to further disguise the malicious traffic. The C2 server receives the POST request, extracts the data from the body, and decodes or decrypts it for further analysis and exploitation.</p>
<p>To detect data exfiltration via POST body, we can employ network monitoring and analysis tools to aggregate all data sent to specific IP addresses and ports. By analyzing the aggregated data, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate data exfiltration attempts.</p>
<p>In this section, we will monitor the volume of outgoing traffic from our network to specific IP addresses and ports. If we observe unusually large or frequent data transfers to a specific destination, it may indicate data exfiltration.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-exfiltration-dns-">Detecting Exfiltration (DNS)</h2>
<p>Attackers employ <code>DNS-based exfiltration</code> due to its reliability, stealthiness, and the fact that DNS traffic is often allowed by default in network firewall rules. By embedding data within DNS queries and responses, attackers can bypass security controls and exfiltrate data covertly. Below is a detailed explanation of this technique and detection methods:</p>
<p><strong>How DNS Exfiltration Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Initial Compromise</code>: The attacker gains access to the victim&#39;s network, typically through malware, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Data Identification and Preparation</code>: The attacker locates the data they want to exfiltrate and prepares it for transmission. This usually involves encoding or encrypting the data and splitting it into small chunks.</li>
<li><code>Exfiltration via DNS</code>: The attacker sends the data in the subdomains of DNS queries, utilizing techniques such as DNS tunneling or fast flux. They typically use a domain under their control or a compromised domain for this purpose. The attacker&#39;s DNS server receives the queries, extracts the data, and reassembles it.</li>
<li><code>Data Retrieval and Analysis</code>: After exfiltration, the attacker decodes or decrypts the data and analyzes it.</li>

<h2 id="detecting-ransomware">Detecting Ransomware</h2>
<p><code>Ransomware</code> leverage an array of techniques to accomplish their goals. In the following analysis, we&#39;ll explore two of these methods, examining their inner workings and explaining how to detect them through network monitoring efforts.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>File Overwrite Approach</code>: Ransomware employs this tactic by accessing files through the SMB protocol, encrypting them, and then directly overwriting the original files with their encrypted versions (again through the SMB protocol). The malicious actors behind ransomware prefer this method for its efficiency, as it requires fewer actions and leaves less trace of their activity. To detect this approach, security teams should look for excessive file overwrite operations on the system. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/121.png" alt=""></li>
<li><code>File Renaming Approach</code>: In this approach, ransomware actors use the SMB protocol to read files, they then encrypt them and they finally rename the encrypted files by appending a unique extension (again through the SMB protocol), often indicative of the ransomware strain. The renaming signals that the files have been held hostage, making it easier for analysts and administrators to recognize an attack. Detection involves monitoring for an unusual number of files being renamed with the same extension, particularly those associated with known ransomware variants. <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/233/122.png" alt=""></li>
